In trees irrigated every day, the tangential strain of the stems increased gradually with a regular diurnal pattern. On the other hand, in trees irrigated every 3 days, both the maximum and the minimum tangential strains within a stem increased every 3 days. In both irrigation conditions, the tangential strain showed a minimum value immediately before irrigation, and a maximum value around the onset of light within a day. The fluctuation of xylem pressure potential was similar to that of the tangential strain in both irrigation conditions. Stems of trees irrigated every 3 days shrank and swelled more than those irrigated every day with the same water potential change. The diameter of tracheids produced during the experimental period was larger in trees irrigated every day and smaller in trees irrigated every 3 days than that before the experiment. The number of cell layers of cells in the cell expanding zone and the cambial zone, and the tracheid diameter in the cell expanding zone were smaller in trees irrigated every 3 days than in trees irrigated every day.},

  abstract = {Rubber plantation is the most important commercial monoculture crop in northern Southeast Asia. Despite the large number of studies documenting the biological impacts of rubber plantations, most focus on changes in overall diversity, and little attention has been paid to other ecological aspects such as biogeographic affinities. Rubber cultivation, like other human-induced disturbances, non-randomly selects for species that can colonize altered environments or have generalized habitat requirements. Consequently, species in rubber plantations are expected to have broader geographic ranges than species in undisturbed habitats. To test this, we used an online database (antmaps.org) to compare the geographic distribution of ants in major habitat types (rainforest, limestone forest, and rubber plantation) in Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. Additionally, we conducted a meta-analysis of 24 other papers and compared the geographic distribution of ants in primary and secondary forests, and rubber plantations. Our results showed that rubber-plantation ants had, on average, wider geographic distributions, compared with rainforest and limestone-forest ants in Xishuangbanna. The same distributional pattern was observed from the global meta-analysis. Species that were characteristic of rubber plantations occupied wider geographic distributions than primary-forest ants, while secondary forest ants had intermediate geographic distributions. However, when only native ants were analyzed, geographic distributions did not vary among the three habitats. Our results show that forest conversion to monoculture rubber plantations replaces habitat specialist species with non-native generalists which have broader geographic distributions. This replacement by generalists results in homogenization of ants in disturbed habitats, which may alter ecosystem functions and services.},

We investigated xylem phenology of silver fir (               Abies alba               Mill.) in three sites in Italy, between the 38               th               and 46               th               parallels. The phases of xylem phenology were assessed weekly on wood microcores collected from March to November 2015 to calculate timing and duration of xylem cell production. The effect of temperature and precipitation on xylem phenology were sequentially included in stepwise regressions and used to predict the duration of each phenological phase under three future climatic scenarios at different concentrations of greenhouse gases (RCP 2.6; 4. 5; 8. 5). A growing season of 163 days was detected in the southern site that was longer compared to the central (132 days) and northern (120 days) sites. A longer duration of xylogenesis was mostly related to a delayed completion of xylem differentiation in autumn rather than an earlier onset of cambium reactivation in spring. Overall, 67\textendash 76\% of the duration of phenological phases was controlled by growing season precipitation, while 24 \textendash 33\% was influenced by minimum temperature. Inclusion of both the above factors in the modelling exercise simulated a lengthening of the silver fir growing season during the 21               st               century. A longer duration of xylogenesis was envisaged in the scenario RCP 8. 5, especially in the central site. Population and climate gradients need to be considered when addressing phenological shifts and growth dynamics of silver fir in Mediterranean mountains.},

Vessel grouping may improve hydraulic integration and increase resilience to cavitation through redundancy of hydraulic pathways. Alternatively, a high degree of hydraulic integration may facilitate the spread of cavitations among neighboring vessels. Here we show how automated image analysis tools such as ROXAS (see www.wsl.ch/roxas) may greatly enhance the capacity for studying vessel grouping while avoiding some methodological limitations of previous approaches. We tested the new analysis techniques by comparing the xylem network of two populations of the herbaceous species Verbascum thapsus collected at a dry and moist site on Big Island (Hawaii, USA). ROXAS accurately, objectively and reproducibly detected grouped and solitary vessels in high-resolution images of entire root cross sections, and calculated different and partly novel vessel grouping parameters, e.g. the percentage of grouped (vs. solitary) vessels among different vessel size classes. Individuals at the dry site showed a higher degree of vessel grouping, less solitary vessels, greater maximum vessel sizes and an increase of the percentage of grouped vessels with increasing vessel size. The potential, but also some limitations of automated image analysis and the proposed novel parameters are discussed.},

We deployed a throughfall removal experiment to simulate a once in a century drought in New Hampshire, USA, which coupled with the region-wide 2016 drought, intensified moisture stress beyond that experienced in the lifetimes of our study trees. To assess the sensitivity and threshold dynamics of two dominant northeastern tree genera (Quercus and Pinus), we monitored sap flux density (Js), leaf water potential and gas exchange, growth and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) for one pretreatment year (2015) and two treatment years (2016\textendash 17). Results showed that Js in pine (Pinus strobus L.) declined abruptly at a soil moisture threshold of 0.15 m3 m-3, whereas oak's (Quercus rubra L. and Quercus velutina Lam.) threshold was 0.11 m3 m-3\textemdash a finding consistent with pine's more isohydric strategy. Nevertheless, once oaks' moisture threshold was surpassed, Js declined abruptly, suggesting that while oaks are well adapted to moderate drought, they are highly susceptible to extreme drought. The radial growth reduction in response to the 2016 drought was more than twice as great for pine as for oaks (50 vs 18\%, respectively). Despite relatively high precipitation in 2017, the oaks' growth continued to decline (low recovery), whereas pine showed neutral (treatment) or improved (control) growth. The iWUE increased in 2016 for both treatment and control pines, but only in treatment oaks. Notably, pines exhibited a significant linear relationship between iWUE and precipitation across years, whereas the oaks only showed a response during the driest conditions, further underscoring the different sensitivity thresholds for these species. Our results provide new insights into how interactions between temperate forest tree species' contrasting physiologies and soil moisture thresholds influence their responses and resilience to extreme drought.},

  abstract = {One of the fundamental problems of modern ecology is assessment of the response of woody plants to environmental effects under changing climate conditions on Earth. Various simulation models of tree ring growth can serve as an effective tool for solving this problem. We have proposed a new simulation model for the functioning of cambium, which reproduces the process of cambial activity of coniferous species of woody plants, depending on the action of the key climatic factors. It is based on the hypothesis of the presence of a cytoplasmic inhibitor of cell differentiation, the functioning of which is limited by temperature, moisture, and illumination. The new algorithm was developed based on the existing cambial block of the Vaganov\textendash Shashkin simulation model of tree ring growth (VS-model). The model has been tested based on indirect observations of the functioning of the cambium of coniferous woody plants in southern Siberia (Republic of Khakassia), namely, on the measured seasonal cell production from 1964 to 2012. A software implementation of the new cambial model based on the R. Shiny technology, which can be easily adapted to the on-line platform of the VS-model, is proposed. The developed widgets (process visualization tools) make it possible to track the growth dynamics of the cambial zone to an accuracy of one-hundredth of a day.【摘要翻译】现代生态学的一个基本问题是评估木本植物在地球气候变化条件下对环境影响的反应。树木年轮生长的各种模拟模型可以作为解决这一问题的有效工具。本文提出了一种新的模拟形成层作用的模型，该模型根据关键气候因子的作用，再现了木本植物针叶树种的形成层活动过程。它是基于细胞质中存在细胞分化抑制剂的假设，这种抑制剂的作用受温度、湿度和光照的限制。该算法是在现有的树木年轮生长的 Vaganov-Shashkin 模拟模型(vs 模型)的形成层块的基础上提出的。这个模型是基于对西伯利亚南部针叶树木本植物形成层功能的间接观察，即1964年至2012年季节性细胞产量的测量而得到验证的。提出了一种基于 r. Shiny 技术的新型形成层模型的软件实现方法，该方法可以很容易地适用于 vs 模型的在线平台。开发的部件(过程可视化工具)使得跟踪形成层区域的增长动态成为可能，精确度达到百分之一天。},

  abstract = {Studies of the relationship between the composition of nectar and its consumers often focus on single or very few species, thus ignoring dynamics in diverse assemblages. Conversely, most documented patterns of nectarivore communities have not been linked to nectar quality measures. In a study of nectar-foraging ant communities in an Australian rain forest, we found that nectar source partitioning between consumers may be driven by two factors: (1) variation in nectar composition preferences mediated by taste and physiological requirements, and (2) severe asymmetrical competitive interactions within the community. Ant communities are strongly shaped by competitive hierarchies. When foraging for extrafloral and floral nectar sources, wound sap, and homopteran honeydew, competitively superior weaver-ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) showed a significant preference for nectar composition, whereas most other common community members were nonselective. Nectars frequently used by O. smaragdina were characterized by similar amino acid profiles and higher sugar and amino acid concentration. We hypothesize that, for nectar\textendash consumer relationships, as for other interactions in complex communities, the interplay between species-specific physiological optima and context-dependent asymmetrical competition is essential to explain consumers' preferences and the dynamics of the system.},

  abstract = {Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) consume a broad spectrum of liquid food sources including nectar and honeydew, which play a key role in their diet especially in tropical forests. This study compares carbohydrates and amino acids from a representative spectrum of liquid sources used by ants in the canopy and understorey of a tropical rainforest in northern Queensland, Australia. Eighteen floral nectars, 16 extrafloral nectars, two wound sap and four homopteran honeydew sources were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography. Wounds comprised flower abscission scars on Normanbya normanbyi L. H. Bailey and bitemarks on Cardwellia sublimis F. Muell. where ants were actively involved in wounding. Discriminant analysis was performed to model differences between food sources in sugar and amino acid concentration and composition. All characteristics varied significantly among plant species. Honeydew contained a broader spectrum of sugars (including melezitose, raffinose, melibiose, lactose and maltose) than nectar (sucrose, glucose, fructose), but certain extrafloral nectars had similar amino acid profiles and, like honeydew sources, were often monopolized by ants. Most common amino acids across the sources were proline, alanine and threonine among 17 \textvisiblespace -amino acids identified. Interspecific variability concealed characteristic differences in sugar and amino acid parameters between nectar, honeydew and wound sap across all plants, but these types differed significantly when found on the same plant. Among all sources studied, only a few flower nectars were naturally not consumed by ants and they were significantly less attended than sugar controls in feeding trials. These nectars did not differ in sugars and amino acids from ant-attended flower nectars, suggesting the activity of repellents. Apart from these exceptions, variability in amino acids and carbohydrates is proposed to play a key role in ant preferences and nutrition.},

  abstract = {Sustainable use of tropical forest systems requires continuous monitoring of biological diversity and ecosystem functions. This can be efficiently done with `early warning` (short-cycle) indicator groups of non-economical insects, whose population levels and resources are readily measured. Twenty-one groups of insects are evaluated as focal indicator taxa for rapid assessment of changes in Neotropical forest systems. Composite environmental indices for heterogeneity, richness, and natural disturbance are correlated positively with butterfly diversity in 56 Neotropical sites studied over many years. Various components of alpha, beta and gamma-diversity show typical responses to increased disturbance and different land-use regimes. Diversity often increases with disturbance near or below natural levels, but some sensitive species and genes are eliminated at very low levels of interference. Agricultural and silvicultural mosaics with over 30\% conversion, including selective logging of three or more large trees per hectare, show shifts in species composition with irreversible loss of many components of the butterfly community, indicating non-sustainable land and resource use and reduction of future options. Monitoring of several insect indicator groups by local residents in a species-rich Brazilian Amazon extractive reserve has helped suggest guidelines for cologically, economically, and socially sustainable zoning and use regimes.},

However, we lack a better mechanistic understanding of bimodality and its potential responses to the predicted warming and aridification trends. Filling this research gap is important since growth duration affects the capacity of trees to form wood and uptake carbon. Here we used an 11-year (1994\textendash 2004) long record of dendrometer data of the Mediterranean Holm oak (Quercus ilex) and compared how climate related to radial increment in trees from the south- and the north-facing slopes. We also related climate variables to tree-ring width and the production of intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs), which reflects bimodality. In this paper, we introduce a model called VS-Lite2 to simulate tree-growth dynamics, which is a modified version of the process-based Vaganov-Shashkin Lite model. The VS-Lite2 model adequately reproduced the bimodal intra-annual pattern of radial growth, IADFs, and annual tree growth. Trees from the south-oriented slope grew more, produced more IADFs and showed a more marked bimodal pattern than trees from the north-facing slope. These differences agree with the observation that late-summer drought constrained growth. Therefore, radial-growth models should consider plastic bimodality and micro-environmental conditions in areas subjected to seasonal droughts.},

The method is based on computing for each input a number of incremental ratios, namely elementary effects, which are then averaged to assess the overall importance of the input. Despite its value, the method is still rarely used and instead local analyses varying one factor at a time around a baseline point are usually employed. In this piece of work we propose a revised version of the elementary effects method, improved in terms of both the definition of the measure and the sampling strategy. In the present form the method shares many of the positive qualities of the variance-based techniques, having the advantage of a lower computational cost, as demonstrated by the analytical examples. The method is employed to assess the sensitivity of a chemical reaction model for dimethylsulphide (DMS), a gas involved in climate change. Results of the sensitivity analysis open up the ground for model reconsideration: some model components may need a more thorough modelling effort while some others may need to be simplified.},

So far, the physiology behind wood formation processes and the associated kinetics has rarely been considered to explain this pattern. We developed a process-based mechanistic model that simulates the development of conifer tracheids, explicitly considering the processes of cell enlargement and the deposition and lignification of cell walls. The model assumes that (1) wall deposition gradually slows down cell enlargement and (2) the deposition of cellulose and lignin is regulated by the availability of soluble sugars. The model reliably reproduces the anatomical traits and kinetics of the tracheids of four conifer species. At the beginning of the growing season, low sugar availability in the cambium results in slow wall deposition that allows for a longer enlargement time; thus, large cells with thin walls (i.e., earlywood) are produced. In late summer and early autumn, high sugar availability produces narrower cells having thick cell walls (i.e., latewood). This modeling framework provides a mechanistic link between plant ecophysiology and wood phenology and significantly contributes to understanding the role of sugar availability during xylogenesis.},

In this study, we investigated a proxy of the degree of iso/anisohydry\textemdash the water potential at stomatal closure\textemdash and a series of functional traits of leaves and branches in 20 temperate broadleaf species planted in an arid limestone habitat in northern China. The results showed that the water potential at stomatal closure was significantly correlated with many functional traits. At the anisohydric end of the spectrum, species had a higher leaf carbon content and vein density, a greater stomatal length, a thicker lower leaf epidermis, higher embolism resistance, higher wood density, a greater Huber value, a greater ratio of fiber wall thickness to xylem lumen diameter, a larger proportion of total fiber wall area to xylem cross-sectional area, a lower water potential at the turgor loss point, a smaller relative water content at the turgor loss point, a lower osmotic potential at full turgor and a smaller specific leaf area. It is concluded that a continuum of coordination and trade-offs among co-evolved anatomical and physiological traits gives rise to the spectrum from isohydry to anisohydry spanned by the 20 tree species, and the anisohydric species showed stronger stress resistance with greater investment in stems and leaves than the isohydric species to maintain stomatal opening under drought conditions.},

We conducted a seven-year afforestation trial with 20 drought-resistant broadleaf tree species in an arid limestone habitat in northern China, where the species displayed a broad range of survival rates. The stomatal and xylem hydraulic traits of all the species were measured. We found that species' stomatal closure points were strongly related to their xylem embolism resistance and xylem minimum water potential but not to their survival rates. Hydraulic failure of the vascular system appeared to be the main cause of tree mortality, and the stomatal safety margin was a better predictor of tree mortality than the traditionally considered xylem embolism resistance and hydraulic safety margin. We recommend the stomatal safety margin as the indicator for predicting drought-induced tree mortality and for selecting tree species in future forest restorations in arid regions.},

The effects of a substantial number of xylem traits on water transport, embolism resistance, mechanical support, storage capacity and nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) content were investigated in 19 temperate broadleaf species planted in an arid limestone habitat in northern China. There was no xylem hydraulic efficiency-safety tradeoff in the 19 broadleaf species. The total parenchyma fraction was negatively correlated with the fiber fraction. Embolism resistance was positively correlated with indicators of xylem mechanical strength such as vessel wall reinforcement, vessel wall thickness and fiber wall thickness, and was negatively related to the axial parenchyma fraction, especially the paratracheal parenchyma fraction. The paratracheal parenchyma fraction was positively correlated with the ratio of the paratracheal parenchyma fraction to the vessel fraction. In addition, the xylem NSC concentration was positively related to the total parenchyma fraction and axial parenchyma fraction. There was a storage capacity-embolism resistance tradeoff in the xylem of 19 broadleaf species in arid limestone habitats. We speculate that the temperate broadleaf species may show a spectrum of xylem hydraulic strategies, from the embolism resistance strategy related to a more negative P50 (the water potential corresponding to 50\% loss of xylem conductivity) to the embolization repair strategy based on more paratracheal parenchyma.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity awareness days are awareness-raising interventions of increasing popularity. But what makes an awareness day campaign successful has been overlooked. We sought to determine (1) if species or taxa awareness days led to awareness proxied by engagement for information, (2) if some awareness days were more effective than others, and the possible reasons for success, and (3) if awareness days led to positive conservation action. Google Trends and Wikipedia page views of the subject of biodiversity awareness days with a history of at least five years were compiled and analyzed. For 16 awareness days examined, there was an average of 3.07\% increase in Google searches and 34.0\% increase in Wikipedia page views. Awareness days for pangolin, polar bear, turtle, and tiger (25\% of taxa) had significant increases in both metrics, and 43.8\% of taxa had success in at least one metric. Over half of taxonomic groups, which include species considered charismatic and appealing, saw no clear increase in information-seeking behavior. Tweets containing a call to action had a positive relationship with the number of retweets. Some awareness days appeared to correspond to an increase in conservation fund-raising for advocacy groups and charities that participated in the event. Overall, the results suggest that resources diverted to promoting awareness days might be better allocated to less popular threatened species, and that advocacy groups and charities may want to consider optimizing their messages and participation to maximize benefits of these events.},

However, very few models are able to predict species distribution accurately, although we know species respond individually to climate change. Here we show, using a process-based model (PHENOFIT), that tree species distributions can be predicted precisely if the biological processes of survival and reproductive success only are incorporated as a function of phenology. These predictions showed great predictive power when tested against present distributions of two North American species {$\pm$} quaking aspen and sugar maple {$\pm$} indicating that on a broad scale, the fundamental niche of trees coincides with their realized niche. Phenology is shown here to be a major determinant of plant species range and should therefore be used to assess the consequences of global warming on plant distributions, and the spread of alien plant species.},

The study was based on microscopic observations of micro-cores taken from stems at weekly intervals from mid-April until mid-October 2008. These observations allowed us to identify the timing of xylem and phloem formation. Cambial divisions, xylem and phloem formation had already started before the first sampling. By the end of April, the first earlywood vessels were already lignified and in early phloem the first formed sieve cells had finished postcambial growth. Formation of earlywood was completed by the end of May, which was about 2\textendash 3 weeks earlier than the completion of early phloem. The highest production of xylem cells was recorded between mid-May and mid-June and of phloem ones from mid-June until mid-July. Wood and phloem production mainly terminated in the middle of August while differentiation of xylem cells lasted until mid-October. The phloem ring was completed by the beginning of October 2008. Xylem growth rings were on average 2027 {$\pm$} 635 ␮m wide and phloem rings 265 {$\pm$} 68 ␮m. The proportion of latewood was 73 {$\pm$} 8\% and of late-phloem 49 {$\pm$} 11\%.},

Here the classical view represented by the `Gompertz function (GF) approach' was challenged using two novel approaches based on parametric generalized linear models (GLMs) and `data-driven' generalized additive models (GAMs). These three approaches (GFs, GLMs, and GAMs) were used to describe seasonal changes in cell numbers in each of the xylem differentiation phases and to calculate the timing of cell development in three conifer species [Picea abies (L.), Pinus sylvestris L., and Abies alba Mill.]. GAMs outperformed GFs and GLMs in describing intra-annual wood formation dynamics, showing two left-skewed bell-shaped curves for division and enlargement, and a right-skewed bimodal curve for thickening. Cell residence times progressively decreased through the season for enlargement, whilst increasing late but rapidly for thickening. These patterns match changes in cell anatomical features within a tree ring, which allows the separation of earlywood and latewood into two distinct cell populations. A novel statistical approach is presented which renews our understanding of xylogenesis, a dynamic biological process in which the rate of cell production interplays with cell residence times in each developmental phase to create complex seasonal patterns.},

  abstract = {We investigated whether timing and rate of growth are related to the life strategies and fitness of three conifer species. Intraannual dynamics of wood formation, shoot elongation and needle phenology were monitored over 3 years in five Norway spruces (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), five Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) and five silver firs (Abies alba Mill.) grown intermixed. For the three species, the growing season (delimited by cambial activity onset and cessation) lasted about 4 months, while the whole process of wood formation lasted 5\textendash 6 months. Needle unfolding and shoot elongation followed the onset of cambial activity and lasted only one-third of the season. Pines exhibited an `extensive strategy' of cambial activity, with long durations but low growth rates, while firs and spruces adopted an `intensive strategy' with shorter durations but higher growth rates. We estimated that about 75\% of the annual radial increment variability was attributable to the rate of cell production, and only 25\% to its duration. Cambial activity rates culminated at the same time for the three species, whereas shoot elongation reached its maximal rate earlier in pines. Results show that species-specific life strategies are recognizable through functional traits of intra-annual growth dynamics. The opposition between Scots pine extensive strategy and silver fir and Norway spruce intensive strategy supports the theory that pioneer species are greater resource expenders and develop riskier life strategies to capture resources, while shade-tolerant species utilize resources more efficiently and develop safer life strategies. Despite different strategies, synchronicity of the maximal rates of cambial activity suggests a strong functional convergence between co-existing conifer species, resulting in head-on competition for resources.},

We hypothesized that tree carbon reserves are crucial for resilience of beech, buffering the source\textendash sink imbalance due to late frosts and summer droughts, and that different components of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) play specific roles in coping with stressful situations. To assess the compound effects on mature trees of two extreme weather events, first a late frost in spring 2016 and then a drought in summer 2017, we monitored the phenology, radial growth and the dynamics of starch and soluble sugars in a Mediterranean beech forest. A growth reduction of 85\% was observed after the spring late frost, yet not after the drought event. We observed a strong impact of late frost on starch, which also affected its dynamic at the beginning of the subsequent vegetative season. In 2017, the increase of soluble sugars, associated with starch hydrolysis, played a crucial role in coping with the severe summer drought. Non-structural carbohydrates helped to counteract the negative effects of both events, supporting plant survival and buffering source\textendash sink imbalances under stressful conditions. Our findings indicate a strong trade-off between growth and NSC storage in trees. Overall, our results highlight the key role of NSCs on beech trees, response to extreme weather events, confirming the resilience of this species to highly stressful events. These insights are useful for assessing how forests may respond to the potential impacts of climate change on ecosystem processes in the Mediterranean area.},

He explains why youth is such a sensitive period, during which brain plasticity is maximal, but also assures us that our abilities continue into adulthood, and that we can enhance our learning and memory at any age. We can all "learn to learn" by taking maximal advantage of the four pillars of the brain's learning algorithm: attention, active engagement, error feedback, and consolidation. The human brain is an extraordinary machine. Its ability to process information and adapt to circumstances by reprogramming itself is unparalleled, and it remains the best source of inspiration for recent developments in artificial intelligence. The exciting advancements in A.I. of the last twenty years reveal just as much about our remarkable abilities as they do about the potential of machines. How We Learn finds the boundary of computer science, neurobiology, and cognitive psychology to explain how learning really works and how to make the best use of the brain's learning algorithms, in our schools and universities as well as in everyday life"--},

  abstract = {In social species, the interactions that occur between individuals and also between individuals and their environment can lead to various spatial distributions. Our goal was to understand how both factors (social and environmental) can affect such spatial distribution of individuals. Aggregation experiments were conducted on the ant Crematogaster scutellaris: the level of inter-attraction between individuals was characterized and the influence of an environmental factor (light intensity) was studied. Two ethological castes (brood-tenders and foragers) were tested, showing a strong and similar aggregation pattern\textemdash although faster for foragers. This difference could be explained by a higher degree of inter-attraction for brood-tenders, resulting in longer interaction time and therefore a slower aggregation rate. We also showed the influence of light conditions by carrying out experiments in total darkness and under red light. C. scutellaris appeared highly sensitive to the red light, aggregating just underneath it. Nevertheless, the level of aggregation is not affected by the luminosity condition. These results are discussed in relation to the ecology of the species, and are compared with results obtained in another ant species, Lasius niger, which exhibits a similar response to aggregation. We propose, therefore, a general link between the level/ pattern of aggregation and polyethism in ants.},

  abstract = {In trees, water and sugars are transported by xylem and phloem conduits which are hydraulically linked. A simultaneous study of both flows is interesting, since they concurrently influence important processes such as stomatal regulation and growth. A few mathematical models have already been developed to investigate the influence of both hydraulically coupled flows. However, none of these models has so far been tested using real measured field data. In the present study, a comprehensive whole-tree model is developed that enables simulation of the stem diameter variations driven by both the water and sugar transport. Stem diameter variations are calculated as volume changes of both the xylem and the phloem tissue. These volume changes are dependent on: (i) water transport according to the cohesion\textendash tension theory; (ii) sugar transport according to the Mu\textasciidieresis{} nch hypothesis; (iii) loading and unloading of sugars; and (iv) irreversible turgor-driven growth. The model considers three main compartments (crown, stem, and roots) and is verified by comparison with actual measured stem diameter variations and xylem sap flow rates. These measurements were performed on a young oak (Quercus robur L.) tree in controlled conditions and on an adult beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) tree in a natural forest. A good agreement was found between simulated and measured data. Hence, the model seemed to be a realistic representation of the processes observed in reality. Furthermore, the model is able to simulate several physiological variables which are relatively difficult to measure: phloem turgor, phloem osmotic pressure, and Mu\textasciidieresis{} nch's counterflow. Simulation of these variables revealed daily dynamics in their behaviour which were mainly induced by transpiration. Some of these dynamics are experimentally confirmed in the literature, while others are not.},

Xylem and phloem growth represent both the means used to achieve these structural adjustments and a good indicator of plant success and performance. This chapter reviews the growth dynamics of the xylem and phloem and explores how resource availability and environmental variation provides important context for understanding the impacts of global change. We first illustrate the intra-annual patterns of xylem and phloem growth in different areas of the world to highlight the variations caused by the environment. Then, the components of the growth process, from timing (phenology) to the rates and the characteristics of xylem anatomy are presented to explain how these components are marking valuable indications of the way plants growth respond to changing environmental conditions. Finally we discuss how wood formation can contribute to advancements in ecophysiology and dendroecology.},

They provide strong mechanical strength to tracheary elements and fibres, and ultimately to plant organs. The principal components of secondary walls are cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Cellulose microfibrils together with hemicelluloses form the main load-bearing network in secondary walls, in which lignin is impregnated to form another crosslinked network to provide hydrophobicity and more rigidity. The biosynthesis of secondary walls is a highly coordinated developmental process that involves a coordinated expression of secondary wall biosynthetic genes regulated by a cascade of transcription factors. Because secondary walls in the form of wood and fibres are the most abundant, renewable plant products, understanding how they are constructed will provide novel strategies for genetic improvement of wood and fibres to better suit our needs. Key concepts Cell walls are the plant `exoskeleton' that dictates the cell shape and collectively the plant form. The ability for plant cells to make secondary cell walls is considered to be one of the most important evolutionary landmarks for vascular plants. Secondary cell walls are the main constituent of tracheary elements and fibres of wood, which is the most abundant biomass produced by land plants. Secondary cell walls in tracheary elements and fibres provide mechanical strength to plant organs. Secondary cell walls in tracheary elements are deposited in specific patterns, including helical, annular, scalariform, reticulated and pitted patterns. The principal components of secondary cell walls are cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. Cellulose is synthesized by the cellulose synthase complexes located at the plasma membrane. Hemicelluloses, including glucomannan and xylan, are synthesized at the Golgi and then secreted via vesicles into the cell walls. Lignin is synthesized through dehydrogenative polymerization of monolignols, p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol and syringyl alcohol, which is catalysed by oxidases including peroxidases and laccases. The biosynthesis of secondary cell walls is regulated by a transcriptional network comprising of a cascade of transcription factors.},

This review considers the use of dendrometers with high spatial and temporal precision in past and present research, the value of which is increasingly being realised. Various insights into tree growth and physiology can be obtained using high-resolution dendrometers, including the assessment of stem daily water status and the understanding of short-term growth responses to changing environmental conditions. This kind of data is useful for irrigation scheduling, assessing site quality, and developing models of the main drivers of tree growth at sub-diurnal resolution. A third, more novel application is the potential these instruments provide as a ``template'' that relates temporal measurement of growth to spatial measurements of wood properties. Accordingly, this kind of ``re-scaled'' data is useful in linking environmental conditions which prevailed as the wood formed to varying wood properties along a pith-to-bark wood profile of the sort generated by systems like CSIRO's SilviScanTM. This can provide valuable insights into how tree ring structure and radially varying wood properties represent past climates. The development of dendrometers, their use in these three main areas, and a systematic approach to growth-wood property rescaling is discussed in this review.},

In this work, we presented the free/libre open-source software AutoCellRow (ACR), a ready-to-use tool for automatic QWA in conifers. The ACR analyzes radial files of cells on cross-sections views of tree rings and provides automatic measurements of different cell parameters (e.g., lumen radial diameter, double cell wall thickness and cell radial diameter) for each cell along the selected radial file. The ACR measurements are based on high performed image analysis of xylem cells. The accuracy of the software measurements was tested in cross-sections of five conifer species from a semi-arid area of southern Siberia, and compared with measurements obtained by a semiautomatic tool. Our results suggested high accuracy in the ACR cell traits measurements, facilitating and speeding the analysis of quantitative wood anatomy in conifers over radial files of cells.【摘要翻译】定量木材解剖学(QWA)是一个正在发展的树轮年代学，允许获得大量的参数，如细胞元素的数量，大小和空间排列，突出树木对其环境的调整元素。在这项工作中，我们介绍了免费的/libre 开源软件自动切割工具(ACR) ，这是一个针叶树自动 QWA 的现成工具。ACR 分析树木年轮截面图上细胞的径向文件，并自动测量每个细胞沿着选定的径向文件的不同细胞参数(如内腔径向直径、双细胞壁厚度和细胞径向直径)。ACR 测量是基于木质部细胞的高精度图像分析。对西伯利亚南部一个半干旱地区的五种针叶树种的横断面进行了软件测量的准确性测试，并与半自动工具测量结果进行了比较。结果表明，ACR 细胞性状测量具有较高的准确性，有利于加快针叶树在细胞径向锉上的木材解剖定量分析。},

To learn more about the forces driving changes within tropical forests, we investigated shifts in tree species composition over the past 25 years within the 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, and examined how observed patterns relate to predictions of (1) random population fluctuations, (2) carbon fertilization, (3) succession from past disturbance, (4) recovery from an extreme El Nin\texttildelow o drought at the start of the study period, and (5) long-term climate change. We found that there have been consistent and directional changes in the tree species composition. These shifts have led to increased relative representations of drought-tolerant species as determined by the species' occurrence both across a gradient of soil moisture within BCI and across a wider precipitation gradient from a dry forest near the Pacific coast of Panama to a wet forest near its Caribbean coast. These nonrandom changes cannot be explained by stochastic fluctuations or carbon fertilization. They may be the legacy of the El Nin\texttildelow o drought, or alternatively, potentially reflect increased aridity due to long-term climate change. By investigating compositional changes, we increased not only our understanding of the ecology of tropical forests and their responses to large-scale disturbances, but also our ability to predict how future global change will impact some of the critical services provided by these important ecosystems.},

Their broad dietary niche, however, in conjunction with their sociality, makes this group of animals notoriously difficult to study with respect to nutritional ecology. Natural-abundance-stable-isotope studies are a useful tool for assessing the trophic position of ants in food webs. In theory, they may also help to assess the relative contribution of food sources to their biomass, although such quantitative estimates have to be taken with caution. Consumers are typically enriched in 15N and sometimes 13C relative to their diet. The magnitude of enrichment may be influenced by feeding mode, diet quality and possibly nitrogen-recycling endosymbiotic bacteria. We provide an estimate of the enrichment of stable isotopes relative to a chemically defined diet for the ant Camponotus floridanus (BUCKLEY, 1866) and show that their endosymbiotic bacteria do not significantly alter the enrichment process. The average enrichment of C. floridanus pupae to their diet was 3.0\textperthousand{} for 15N and 1.1\textperthousand{} for 13C.},

We characterized the joint influences of tree size, competition, and climate on diameter growth using hierarchical Bayesian methods applied to permanent sample plot data from the montane forests of Mount Rainier National Park, Washington State, USA, which are mostly comprised of Abies amabilis Douglas ex Forbes, Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg., Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco, and Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don. Individual growth was sensitive to climate under low but not high competition, likely because tree ability to increase growth under more favorable climates (generally greater energy availability) was constrained by competition, with important variation among species. Thus, climate change will likely increase individual growth most in uncrowded stands with lower competition. However, crowded stands have more and (or) larger trees, conferring greater capacity for aggregate absolute growth increases. Due to these contrasting effects, our models predicted that climate change will lead to greater stand-scale growth increases in stands with medium compared with low crowding but similar increases in stands with medium and high crowding. Thus, competition will mediate the impacts of climate change on individual- and stand-scale growth in important but complex ways.},

Information about the degree of the traits' intraspecific variability may guide the selection of drought-resistant genotypes and is crucial for trait-based modelling approaches. For the three temperate minor broadleaf tree species Acer platanoides, Carpinus betulus and Tilia cordata, we measured xylem embolism resistance (P50), leaf turgor loss point (PTLP), specific hydraulic conductivity (KS), Huber values (HV), and hydraulic safety margins in adult trees across a precipitation gradient. We further quantified trait variability on different organizational levels (inter-specific to within-canopy variation), and analyzed its relationship to climatic and soil water availability. Although we observed a certain intra-specific trait variability (ITV) in safety-related traits (P50, PTLP) with higher within-tree and between-tree than between populations variability, the magnitude was small compared to inter-specific differences, which explained 78.4\% and 58.3\% of the variance in P50 and PTLP, respectively. In contrast, efficiency-related traits (KS, HV) showed a high ITV both within populations and within the crowns of single trees. Surprisingly, the observed ITV of all traits was neither driven by climatic nor soil water availability. In conclusion, the high degree of conservatism in safety-related traits highlights their potential for trait-based modelling approaches.},

The expected changes in monsoon flow would lead to heterogeneous moisture conditions during the growing season, and increase the occurrence of IADF in trees of the arid ecosystems of continental Asia. To reveal the timings and physiological mechanisms behind IADF formation, we monitored cambial activity and wood formation in Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis) during 2017-2019 at three sites in semi-arid China. We compared the dynamics of xylem formation under a drought event, testing the hypothesis that drought affects the process of cell enlargement and thus induces the production of IADF. Wood microcores collected weekly from April to October were used for anatomical analyses to estimate the timings of cambial activity, and the phases of enlargement, wall thickening and lignification of the xylem. The first cells started enlargement from late April to early May. The last latewood cells completed differentiation in mid-September. Trees produced IADF in 2018. During that year, a drought in June limited cell production in the cambium, only 36\% of the xylem cells being formed in IADF trees, compared to 68\% in normal tree rings. IADF cells enlarged under drought in early July and started wall thickening during the rainfall events of late July. The drought restricted cell enlargement and affected wall thickening, resulting in narrow cells with wide walls. Cambium and cell enlargement recovered from the abundant rainfall, producing a new layer with large earlywood tracheids. IADF is a specific adaptation of trees to cope with water deficit events occurring during xylem formation. Our findings confirmed the hypothesis that the June-July drought induces latewood-like IADFs by limiting the process of cell enlargement in the xylem. Our finding suggests a higher occurrence of IADF in trees of arid and semi-arid climates of continental Asia if the changes to monsoon flows result in more frequent drought events during the earlywood formation in June.},

Whereas spatial statistics have been widely used to study the distribution of trunk locations, less research has been undertaken to analyse the distribution of crown centres and asymmetric growth at the stand level. It is generally assumed that trees optimise light harvesting via more regular crown patterns. In this study, we primarily ask whether random crown patterns can be found in deciduous and coniferous forests located in continental Europe. Here, we analysed the spatial patterns of trunks, crowns and crowns of overstory trees in different deciduous and coniferous stands, using the scale-dependent g-function and Monte Carlo simulations. We also tested whether the extent of asymmetric growth, that is the crown vector length between the stem-base position and the centroid of the projected crown area, would be greater in angiosperms than in gymnosperms. Finally, we applied circular statistics to test whether trees preferentially bend in slope direction or towards incoming solar radiation. In the deciduous stands, patterns of crowns and upper crowns were random. Response to large-scale heterogeneity in light was strong, because trees bent significantly in downward direction of the slopes. The extent of asymmetric growth was significantly greater in angiosperms than in gymnosperms. The patterns of crowns and upper crowns were regular in a mixed coniferous stand but random in a dense stand with regularly planted Douglas-fir. Mechanical instability caused mutual crown support and attraction between the crowns in this dense stand. The even-aged, slender Douglas-fir clustered significantly in downward direction of the slope. In none of the four stands, trees clustered in southerly direction towards incoming solar radiation.},

While many studies have been published on xylem phenology and anatomy lately, little is known about the phenology of earlywood and latewood formation, also in relation to cambial phenology. Even less information is available for phloem. Here, we examined year-to-year variability of the transition dates from earlywood to latewood and from early phloem to late phloem in Norway spruce (Picea abies) from three temperate sites, two in Slovenia and one in the Czech Republic. Data on xylem and phloem formation were collected during 2009\textendash 2011. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the specific contribution of growth rate and duration on wood and phloem production, separately for early and late formed parts. We found significant differences in the transition date from earlywood to latewood between the selected sites, but not between growth seasons in trees from the same site. It occurred in the first week of July at PAN and MEN and more than two weeks later at RAJ. The duration of earlywood formation was longer than that of latewood formation; from 31.4 days at PAN to 61.3 days at RAJ. In phloem, we found differences in transition date from early phloem to late phloem also between the analysed growth seasons; from 2.5 weeks at PAN to 4 weeks at RAJ Compared to the transition from earlywood to latewood the transition from early phloem to late phloem occurred 25\textendash 64 days earlier. There was no significant relationship between the onset of cambial cell production and the transition dates. The findings are important to better understand the inter-annual variability of these phenological events in spruce from three contrasting temperate sites, and how it is reflected in xylem and phloem anatomy.},

  abstract = {Predicting the outcome of competitive interactions is a fundamental goal in ecology. Ecological stoichiometry, which relates nutrient balance to ecological processes, provides a framework for identifying mechanistic links among macronutrient availability, nutritional physiology and competitive performance. Because carbohydrates serve as a principal metabolic fuel, carbohydrate scarcity may impinge upon behaviours affecting competitive dominance (e.g. aggression, activity) to a greater extent than deficiencies of protein or other nutrients used preferentially for growth. Here, we tested this prediction with a diet manipulation study involving laboratory colonies of Argentine ants (               Linepithema humile               ), a widespread and aggressive invasive species. The availability of both sucrose and insect prey influenced brood production and worker survival after three months. However, colonies became less aggressive and less active only when deprived of sucrose (but not prey). Scarcity of sucrose (but not prey) was also associated with reduced fat mass in individual workers. These data provide the first experimental support that carbohydrate scarcity compromises aggression and activity in ants, and illustrate, in principle, how access to carbohydrate-rich resources (e.g. plant exudates, hemipteran honeydew) might influence behavioural investments that contribute to competitive performance. Such investments might be especially important for invasive ants, given their aggressiveness and tendency to interact with honeydew-producing Hemiptera.},

These chlorophyll-containing tissues (the chlorenchymes) within the stems are able to use the stem internal CO2 and the light penetrating the rhytidome to photoassimilate and produce sugars and starch. Although net photosynthetic uptake of CO2 is rarely found, stem internal re-fixation of CO2 in young twigs and branches may compensate for 60\textendash 90\% of the potential respiratory carbon loss. Isolated chlorenchymal tissues reveal rather high rates of net photosynthesis (being up to 75\% of the respective rates for leaf photosynthesis). Corticular photosynthesis is thus thought to be an effective mechanism for recapturing respiratory carbon dioxide before it diffuses out of the stem. Furthermore, chloroplasts of the proper wood or pith fraction also take part in stem internal photosynthesis. Although there has been no strong experimental evidence until now, we suggest that the oxygen evolved during wood or pith photosynthesis may play a decisive role in avoiding/reducing stem internal anaerobiosis.},

For the analysis, microcores were taken weekly from two corresponding stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) with various ages (35- and 106-years-old) during the growing season 2012 in the Czech Republic. Young specimens were characterised by higher cambium activity; however, more considerable variation and imbalance were found there. In old trees, delayed processes during the development of the xylem and phloem at the cell level were proved. The cambium activity started in March till mid-April, and it lasted for 22 weeks in both cases. The commencement of xylogenesis was established in the first half of May. In both investigated stands, the fully lignified ring was observed at the end of October. For the creation of most xylem cells, it was required 124 and 121 days in the young and old stands, respectively. Daily increment of 0.57 (young) and 0.49 (old) cells on average was observed during the active xylem growth. The relationship between air temperature and wood cell formation for both age groups was recorded. The precipitation influenced wood development just in the case of the young trees. Phloem formation was resistant to external influence according to the Pearson correlation coefficient.},

Although many factors influence the dynamics of differentiation and the final dimensions of xylem cells, the associated patterns of variation remain very stable from one year to the next. While radial growth is characterized by an S-shaped curve, the widths of xylem differentiation zones exhibit characteristic skewed bell-shaped curves. These elements suggest a strong internal control of xylogenesis. It has long been hypothesized that much of this regulation relies on a morphogenetic gradient of auxin. However, recent modelling studies have shown that while this hypothesis could account for the dynamics of stem radial growth and the zonation of the developing xylem, it failed to reproduce the characteristic tree-ring structure. Here, we investigated the hypothesis of regulation by a crosstalk between auxin and a second biochemical signal, by using computational morphodynamics. We found that, in conifers, such a crosstalk is sufficient to simulate the characteristic features of wood formation dynamics, as well as the resulting tree-ring structure. In this model, auxin controls cell enlargement rates while another signal (e.g. cytokinin, tracheary element differentiation inhibitory factor) drives cell division and auxin polar transport.},

As antiherbivore defenses ``worn on the outside,'' they pose fewer barriers to experimentation than do direct (e.g., chemical) plant defenses. This makes them tractable models to study resource allocation to defense and mechanisms regulating it. As multi-trophic level interactions varying in species specificity and impact on fitness of participants, ant-plant-herbivore associations figure prominently in studies of food-web structure and functioning. As horizontally transmitted mutualisms that are vulnerable to parasites and ``cheaters,'' ant-plant symbioses are studied to probe the evolutionary dynamics of interspecies interactions. These symbioses, products of coevolution between plants and insect societies, offer rich material for studying ant social evolution in novel contexts, in settings where colony limits, resource supply, and nest-site availability are all more easily quantifiable than in the ground-nesting ants hitherto used as models.},

In many cases, freezing is not possible in the field, so we investigated the potential of several techniques for preserving tissues for this purpose. We also included preservation techniques used for DNA analyses in order to evaluate how they might alter 6\textdegree C and 6I5N values in tissues and, ultimately, whether archived DNA samples could be used for stable-isotope assay. Tissues included blood and pectoral muscle from quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) and blood from sheep (Ovis aries). Preservation techniques for blood included freeze-drying (control), drying on precombusted glass-fibre filter paper, and storing in 70\% ethanol, 10\% buffered formalin, ABI lysis buffer, and Queen's lysis buffer. After 8 weeks, the use of both lysis buffers and formalin resulted in significant depletion of "C and "N in blood. Values for samples dried on glass-fibre filter paper or stored in 70\% ethanol did not differ significantly from those for the control. Muscle tissue was freeze-dried (control) or stored in 70\% ethanol, 10\% buffered formalin, or DMSO solution. Both the DMSO and formalin treatments resulted in significant depletion of "C and compared with the control. Only the 70\% ethanol treatment did not result in changes to either isotope ratio in muscle. Where freezing is not possible, we recommend that blood samples be dried or stored in 70\% ethanol. Our study provides an estimate of isotopic correction factors that may be applied to tissues archived for DNA analysis or stored in formalin.},

The establishment and maintenance of territories in 0. smaragdina is based on a complex behavioral communication repertory which appears to be almost identical to that of its only living congeneric species, the African weaver ant 0. longinoda. In our study areas, individual territories sometimes covered an area of up to 1500 m2 comprising 21 major trees. The polydomous nest organization makes it possible for an Oecophylla colony to patrol and crop much of the volume of the territory in a very cost efficient way. The guard and defense force which consists primarily of old workers with reduced fatbodies and ovaries, is housed in special barrack nests, located at the territorial boundary. A selective "enemy identification" seems to be the major behavioral mechanism for interspecific territoriality and for the mosaic distribution of ecologically dominant ant species.},

However, the exogenous factors driving wood formation onset and the underlying cellular mechanisms are still poorly understood and quantified, and this hampers an effective assessment of terrestrial forest productivity and carbon budget under global warming. Here, we used an extensive collection of unique datasets of weekly xylem tissue formation (wood formation) from 21 coniferous species across the Northern Hemisphere (latitudes 23 to 67\textdegree N) to present a quantitative demonstration that the onset of wood formation in Northern Hemisphere conifers is primarily driven by photoperiod and mean annual temperature (MAT), and only secondarily by spring forcing, winter chilling, and moisture availability. Photoperiod interacts with MAT and plays the dominant role in regulating the onset of secondary meristem growth, contrary to its as-yet-unquantified role in affecting the springtime phenology of primary meristems. The unique relationships between exogenous factors and wood formation could help to predict how forest ecosystems respond and adapt to climate warming and could provide a better understanding of the feedback occurring between vegetation and climate that is mediated by phenology. Our study quantifies the role of major environmental drivers for incorporation into state-of-the-art Earth system models (ESMs), thereby providing an improved assessment of long-term and high-resolution observations of biogeochemical cycles across terrestrial biomes.},

Excessive spring precipitation occurred during AD 1380s\textendash 1390s, 1410s\textendash 1420s, 1520s\textendash 1560s and 1938 to present.

We monitored seedling establishment for 10 years in five plots located along an elevational gradient of five dominant tree species: Acer rubrum, Betula spp., Liriodendron tulipifera, Nyssa sylvatica, and Quercus rubra. A hierarchical Bayes model allowed us to incorporate different sources of information, observation errors, and the inherent variability of the establishment process. From our analysis, spring temperatures and heterogeneity in soil moisture emerge as key drivers, and they act through nonlinear population demographic processes. We found that all species benefited from warmer springs, in particular the species found on dry slopes, N. sylvatica, and those dominant at higher elevations, Betula spp. and Q. rubra. This last species also benefited from dry environments. Conversely, L. tulipifera, which is abundant on mesic sites, experienced highest establishment rates at high moisture. The mechanisms behind these results may differ among species. Higher temperatures are apparently more important for some, while dry conditions and reduced pathogenic attacks on their seeds and new seedlings have a large impact for others. Our results suggest that only communities found at higher elevations are in danger of regional extinction when their habitats disappear given the current climatic trends. We conclude that the recruitment dynamics of the communities where these species are dominant could be affected by minor changes in climate in ways that cannot be predicted using only climate envelopes, which use different variables and miss the nonlinearities.},

It is thus well suited as a tool for predicting the effects of specific nutrients on consumer activity, abundance, and diversity across the landscape. We tested hypotheses from nutritional ecology in a Neotropical litter ant community by supplementing forest plots with carbohydrates (CHOs) and protein in a blocked factorial design. We tested the Compensation Hypothesis, which posits that consumers accumulate in patches of the rarest food type relative to demand, and the Economics Hypothesis, which assumes that species differ in nutrient based-functional traits, and that changes in nutrient availability will generate changes in species composition and community behavior. We found that CHO and protein had distinct effects on ant density, community composition, and per-worker activity. Ant density increased by 35\% on \th CHO plots but not \th Protein plots, a result supporting the Compensation Hypothesis because CHO-rich plant exudates are uncommon and CHO-demanding microbial productivity is high in this brown food web. Consistent with the Economics Hypothesis, we found that \th CHO plots had higher per-capita ant activity (the Metabolic Fuel Hypothesis) and attracted ants averaging 10\% lower d15N values. Species composition changed as well, with Wasmannia auropunctata, an invasive outside its native range, elsewhere, increasing five-fold on \th CHO plots. Nutritional ecology can thus account for some of the patchiness and behavior of consumers in diverse communities.},

  abstract = {Although the availability of food resources affects a wide range of ecological and evolutionary processes, its role in generating patterns in natural systems remains largely unresolved. Elucidating the importance of resource availability should be made easier by the development of techniques that can measure the amount of resources that are accessible to a consumer, rather than simply the abundance of resources in the environment. In this study, I develop a behavioral assay for inferring the ratio of nutrients available to organisms in the field. The assay involves measuring the responses of foragers to nutrient solutions. These responses are used to determine the mean effective concentration, or ED50, of a nutrient, defined as the concentration that is rejected in 50\% of trials. Because ED50 provides a measure of the quality of a depletable patch at which a consumer would quit foraging, it is analogous to the giving-up density (GUD), a common tool in ecological research. Here, I use ED50s to estimate the ratio of carbohydrates : protein available to ant colonies. Using supplementation experiments, I show that ED50s of sucrose and casein (a source of amino acids) reveal the net rates at which a colony expects to acquire each resource elsewhere in the environment. These results demonstrate that differences in ED50s will reveal differences in the availabilities of nutrients when other factors affecting the costs and benefits of foraging are controlled. To control these factors, I measured a colony's ED50s of sucrose and casein at the same time and location. Using this technique, I found that ratios of carbohydrate : protein availability differed significantly among 10 species of ants in southeastern Arizona, USA. Ratios were highest for species that are known to collect liquids from extrafloral nectaries and phloem-feeding insects. Carbohydrate : protein ratios may be especially low for three granivorous species, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, and Aphaenogaster cockerelli, which accepted sucrose solutions but rejected even highly concentrated casein solutions. Because ratios of carbohydrate : protein availability differed substantially among species in the same habitat, the results of this study suggest that measures of resource abundance may poorly predict habitat quality for consumers.},

Although it has received less attention, food availability may also affect competition through nutritional effects on behavior. One hypothesis linking nutrition and competition in ants posits that increased access to carbohydrates favors greater investment in worker traits that underlie behavioral dominance. We tested this hypothesis by varying dietary protein: carbohydrate (P:C) ratios and levels of interspecific interference for Argentine ants (Linepithema humile), a widespread invasive species. As predicted, colonies facing interference increased patrolling more when reared on low P:C diets; this result is the first demonstration of an interactive effect of nutrition and interference on ant colonies. Several results suggest that this dietary effect on patrolling was due primarily to changes in colony size rather than worker behavior. Colonies on lower P:C diets had lower worker mortality and larger final colony sizes. Diet had little effect on per capita patrolling, and worker behavior in performance assays depended more on previous exposure to interference than on diet. Our findings indicate that dietary P:C ratios can influence Argentine ant performance in a competitive environment and suggest a mechanism by which monopolization of carbohydrate-rich resources can help invasive ants displace native ant competitors. Key words: aggression; behavioral dominance; carbohydrates; defense; foraging; invasive species; Linepithema humile; macronutrients; metabolic fuel hypothesis (MFH); nutrient imbalance; protein; resource allocation.},

First, eBird's data submission design ensures that all data meet high standards of completeness and accuracy. Second, we take a `sensor calibration' approach to measure individual variation in eBird participant's ability to detect and identify birds. Third, we use species distribution models to fill in data gaps. Finally, we provide examples of novel analyses exploring population-level patterns in bird distributions.},

The current study was designed to quantify the biomass carbon stocks in the lesser Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests of the Kashmir region. Primary data about the structural attributes and species composition of the local forests was collected through quadrat-based sampling followed by the application of allometric equations for the estimation of forest biomass. The biomass carbon stocks were calculated as 135.2 Mg ha-1 ranging from a maximum of 226.64 Mg ha-1 to a minimum of 11.83 Mg ha-1. The tree layer contributed a biomass carbon content of 134.67 Mg ha-1 making up to 99\% share in the total forest biomass as compared to the shrub and herb layers with a very low biomass carbon value of 0.37 Mg ha-1 and 0.17 Mg ha-1 respectively. Dalbergia sissoo was recorded as the most dominant tree species with a biomass carbon stock value of 40.70 Mg ha-1 followed by Mallotus philippensis (30.09 Mg ha-1) and Ficus palmata (20.11 Mg ha-1). Principal Component Analysis revealed that the variations in the local carbon stocks were significantly correlated with the distribution pattern of the dominant tree species. Generalized Linear models showed a strong affinity of biomass carbon reserves with the structural attributes of the forest stands. This study generated a standard scientific dataset of the local biomass carbon stocks in the subtropical broadleaf forests with dynamic implications in sustainable forestry and carbon pool management in the region.},

This correlation raises two important questions: (i) to what degree is tree growth limited by C availability; and (ii) is growth limited by concurrent C storage (e.g., as nonstructural carbohydrates, NSC)? To test the relationships between drought, growth and C reserves, we monitored the changes in NSC levels and constructed stem growth chronologies of mature Pinus halepensis Miller trees of three drought stress levels growing in Yatir forest, Israel, at the dry distribution limit of forests. Moderately stressed and stressed trees showed 34 and 14\% of the stem growth, 71 and 31\% of the sap flux density, and 79 and 66\% of the final \-needle length of healthy trees in 2012. In spite of these large reductions in growth and sap flow, both starch and soluble sugar concentrations in the branches of these trees were similar in all trees throughout the dry season (2\textendash 4\% dry mass). At the same time, the root starch concentrations of moderately stressed and stressed trees were 47 and 58\% of those of healthy trees, but never {$<$}2\% dry mass. Our results show that all the studied trees maintain a fairly good coordination between C supply and demand, and even during prolonged drought there is more than one way for a tree to maintain a positive C balance.},

Such measurements need to be time-aligned, cleaned of outliers and shifts, gap-filled and analysed for reversible (water-related) and irreversible (growth-related) fractions to obtain physiologically meaningful data. Therefore, comprehensive tools are needed for reproducible data processing and analytics of dendrometer data. Here we present a transparent method, compiled in the R package treenetproc, to turn raw dendrometer data into clean, physiologically interpretable information, i.e., stem growth, tree water deficit, growth phenological phases, mean daily shrinkage and their respective timings. The removal of errors is facilitated by additional functions and supported with graphical visualizations. To ensure reproducible data handling, the processing parameters and induced changes to the raw data are documented in the output and, thus, are a step towards a standardized processing of automatically measured stem radius time series. We discuss examples, such as the seasonality of growth or the dependence of growth on atmospheric and soil drought. The presented growth and water-related physiological variables at high temporal resolution offer novel physiological insights into the seasonally varying responses of trees to changing environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Numerous theoretical frameworks have been developed to explain the gap between the possession of environmental knowledge and environmental awareness, and displaying pro-environmental behavior. Although many hundreds of studies have been undertaken, no de nitive explanation has yet been found. Our article describes a few of the most in uential and commonly used analytical frameworks: early US linear progression models; altruism, empathy and prosocial behavior models; and nally, sociological models. All of the models we discuss (and many of the ones we do not such as economic models, psychological models that look at behavior in general, social marketing models and that have become known as deliberative and inclusionary processes or procedures (DIPS)) have some validity in certain circumstances. This indicates that the question of what shapes pro-environmental behavior is such a complex one that it cannot be visualized through one single framework or diagram. We then analyze the factors that have been found to have some in uence, positive or negative, on pro-environmental behavior such as demographic factors, external factors (e.g. institutional, economic, social and cultural) and internal factors (e.g. motivation, pro-environmental knowledge, awareness, values, attitudes, emotion, locus of control, responsibilities and priorities). Although we point out that developing a model that tries to incorporate all factors might neither be feasible nor useful, we feel that it can help illuminate this complex eld. Accordingly, we propose our own model based on the work of Fliegenschnee and Schelakovsky (1998) who were in uenced by Fietkau and Kessel (1981).},

  abstract = {At high elevation or latitude, trees reach low-temperature range limits. In attempting an explanation, the range limits of individual tree species (set by freezing tolerance) and the general limit of the life-form tree (set by thermal growth constraints) need to be distinguished. The general cold edge of the fundamental niche of trees is termed the treeline, by definition, the lower edge of the alpine belt, a most important bioclimatological reference line. Trees can be absent from the treeline due to disturbances or biotic interactions. The actual local edge of tree distribution, the delineation of the realized niche, is driven by stochastic effects. Therefore, treeline theory and hypothesis testing is inevitably tied to the fundamental niche concept.},

  abstract = {In this review I first compile data for the worldwide position of climate-driven alpine treelines. Causes for treeline formation are then discussed with a global perspective. Available evidence suggests a combination of a general thermal boundary for tree growth, with regionally variable ``modulatory'' forces, including the presence of certain taxa. Much of the explanatory evidence found in the literature relates to these modulatory aspects at regional scales, whereas no good explanations emerged for the more fundamental global pattern related to temperature per se, on which this review is focused. I hypothesize that the life form ``tree'' is limited at treeline altitudes by the potential investment, rather than production, of assimilates (growth as such, rather than photosynthesis or the carbon balance, being limited). In shoots coupled to a cold atmosphere, meristem activity is suggested to be limited for much of the time, especially at night. By reducing soil heat flux during the growing season the forest canopy negatively affects root zone temperature. The lower threshold temperature for tissue growth and development appears to be higher than 3\textdegree C and lower than 10\textdegree C, possibly in the 5.5\textendash 7.5\textdegree C range, most commonly associated with seasonal means of air temperature at treeline positions. The physiological and developmental mechanisms responsible have yet to be analyzed. Root zone temperature, though largely unknown, is likely to be most critical.},

  abstract = {At present, 50\% (w/w) carbon is widely promulgated as a generic value for wood; however, the literature yields few data and indicates that very little research has actually been done. C contents in heartwood of forty-one softwood and hardwood species were determined. C in kiln-dried hardwood species ranged from 46.27\% to 49.97\% (w/w), in conifers from 47.21\% to 55.2\%. The higher C in conifers agrees with their higher lignin content ({$\sim$} 30\%, versus {$\sim$} 20\% for hardwoods). Wood-meal samples drilled from discrete early wood and late wood zones of seven of the forty-one species were also investigated. C contents of early woods were invariably higher than those in corresponding late woods, again in agreement with early wood having higher lignin content. Further investigation was made into freshly harvested wood of some species to determine how much volatile C is present, comparing oven-dried wood meal with wood meal dried at ambient temperature over a desiccant. C contents of oven-dried woods were signi\"ycantly lower, indicating that all past data on C content in oven- or kiln-dried woods may be inaccurate in relation to the true C content of forests. We conclude that C content varies substantially among species as well as within individual trees. Clearly, a 50\% generic value is an oversimpli\"ycation of limited application in relation to global warming and the concept of ``carbon credits''.},

  abstract = {Trees are able to respond to their local biotic and abiotic environment with morphological adjustments which improve resource acquisition and, thus, growth. In forests, light is broadly recognised as one of the major factors determining growth, and morphological responses comprise changes in crown architecture and stem stature. On sloping terrain, the interplay of phototropism and gravitropism may further affect morphological growth characteristics. However, different tree species are expected to show speciesspecific responses. In this study, we analysed three growth characteristics of tree individuals belonging to four species of two functional groups (evergreen: Schima superba, Castanopsis eyrei, deciduous: Quercus serrata var. brevipetiolata, Castanea henryi) in a species-rich Chinese subtropical forest. Crown projection area, relative crown displacement and stem inclination were related to biotic (local species richness, functional richness, competition, stand age) and abiotic (slope aspect and inclination, soil depth) variables in the local neighbourhood of the tree individuals. We hypothesised that (i) there are species-specific differences in the morphological response of crown architecture and stem stature and (ii) that crown size and asymmetry as well as stem inclination are influenced by both, biotic and abiotic factors. In contrast to our expectations we were unable to reveal any species-specific differences in any of the three growth characteristics. The results of mixed effects models showed that crown area was mainly affected by the target tree's dbh and biotic variables related to neighbours (competition, functional diversity), whereas stem inclination was mainly influenced by slope. Relative crown displacement was influenced by both, biotic and abiotic variables. We conclude that growth responses resulting in crown displacement and stem inclination seem to be an important mechanism to ameliorate foraging for light in our study area, but that these responses appear to be species-independent. The interplay of stem inclination and crown displacement allows for a plastic response of tree individuals in biotically and abiotically heterogeneous environments. Our results indicate that forest management in this region should focus on functionally diverse stands which are promoting crown area positively resulting in increased growth rates of individual trees.},

To have a global understanding of the wood formation, it is necessary to develop new methodologies for xylogenesis measurements, valid across diverse wood structures and applicable to both angiosperms and gymnosperms. In this study, the authors present a new workflow to study xylogenesis using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (HRXCT), which is generic and offers high potential for automatization. The HXRCT-based approach was benchmarked with the current classical approach (microtomy) on three tree species with contrasted wood anatomy (               Pinus nigra, Fagus sylvatica               , and               Quercus robur               ). HRXCT proved to estimate the relevant xylogenesis parameters (timing, duration, and growth rates) across species with high accuracy. HRXCT showed to be an efficient avenue to investigate tree xylogenesis for a wide range of wood anatomies, structures, and species. HRXCT also showed its potential to provide quantification of intra-annual dynamics of biomass production through high-resolution 3D mapping of wood biomass within the forming growth ring.},

To favor one path over another requires ants to perceive, communicate and act upon important differences in length and risk between paths. Here, we present replicate Linepithema humile colonies with four equal-length paths to a sugar source. The paths vary in probabilities of encountering a risk cue that range from 0 to 100\%. The risk cues were either live workers of an aggressive competitor (Liometopum occidentale: LO) or only formic acid (FA), a defensive chemical common in many formicine species. Both the probabilities of encounter and type of cue affected path preferences. Although across both cues the zero-risk path was most used, the use was not exclusive and patterns of response to the cues differed significantly. More ants were on all the paths when the cue was LO rather than FA, leading to a higher success rate at finding food. Worker numbers on paths with LO did decline over time as consistent with recognizing neighbors to be `dear enemies' that are a reduced threat to the colony. Similarly, changes in path usage suggested that the FA cue also became viewed as less threatening over time when competitors were never simultaneously present. The results are consistent with L. humile exhibiting the behavioral plasticity and communicative ability needed to categorize and predict risk to efficiently collect food while defending against other ant species.},

  year = {2015},
  abstract = {作为极端环境下森林分布的上限，高山林线对气候变化具有潜在的敏感性，是全球变化研究的热点内容之一。尽管国际上关于林线形成机制仍存在诸多争议，但从全球尺度上看，林线具有相似的生长季温度 (6.4{$\pm$}0.7 \textdegree C)。然而，这一温度阈值特征目前尚缺乏林线树木形成层活动方面的数据支持，从而限制了学者们对林线形成机制的深入理解。同时，通过对高山灌木形成层活动与气候因子之间关系的分析，有利于揭示高山灌木相对于林线乔木的生存优势，为探讨林线的形成机理提供一个新的视角。迄今为止，国际上尚未开展过有关高山灌木形成层季节活动的研究。 藏东南分布着北半球最高海拔的天然林线，对气候变化具有潜在的敏感性，尤以色季拉山区的高山林线为代表，是树轮生态学和气候学重点研究区域。色季拉山不同坡向上建群树种不同，阴坡以急尖长苞冷杉（Abies georgei var. smithii）为主，阳坡以方枝柏（Juniperus saltuaria）为主。而在阴坡和阳坡的林线以上区域分布的薄毛海绵杜鹃，则是色季拉山最具有代表性的高山灌木。本论文分别对色季拉山2007-2010年间急尖长苞冷杉、方枝柏以及2011-2013年高山薄毛海绵杜鹃（Rhododendron aganniphum var. schizopeplum）的形成层季节活动进行了监测，并分析了其与气候因子间的关系。需要说明的是，考虑到树龄可能会对形成层季节活动造成一定影响，我们首先针对不同树龄的形成层季节活动进行了研究。 论文的主要结论如下： （1）随树龄增加，木质部分化开始日期推迟、细胞产生率降低、生长季变短，最终形成的木质部细胞总数较少。但不同树龄的树木的木质部细胞产生均对最低气温变化响应敏感。 （2）相比于急尖长苞冷杉，方枝柏的形成层区域和分化各阶段的细胞数量较少。虽然急尖长苞冷杉和方枝柏的形成层活动各阶段细胞数量变化趋势一致，但各阶段开始、结束等关键日期却有较大差异。方枝柏的木质部分化开始于5月底至6月中旬，结束于9月初；而急尖长苞冷杉一般则会在5月底集中开始木质部细胞分化，并于9月底结束木质部分化过程，其结束时间较方枝柏晚两周左右。总体而言，色季拉山林线急尖长苞冷杉和方枝柏的最短生长季分别为4个月和3个月。 （3）虽然最低气温、平均气温或最高气温与两林线树种细胞产生率之间呈显著正相关，但在去除生长趋势后，仅最低气温与两林线树种木质部生长指数之间呈现显著正相关，这一结果意味着最低气温是限制林线树种形成层活动的主要气象因子。而且，我们发现存在限制两林线树种木质部分化开始的低温阈值（日最低气温0.8{$\pm$}0.5 \textdegree C），这一温度阈值远低于其他寒冷气候区针叶树的结果（4-5\textdegree C）。基于此模拟未来增温情景下急尖长苞冷杉生长季变化得到了低海拔实际监测结果的验证。同时，这两个树种形成层活动开始于土壤解冻4-36天之后，二者之间无显著的联系，也间接地说明了最低气温对林线树木形成层活动的开始起到了直接的限制作用。 （4）薄毛海绵杜鹃木质部分化开始（6月中旬到6月底）、结束日期（9月中旬至9月底）在不同年份间存在着差异。我们的研究结果暗示了最低气温、平均温度是限制薄毛海绵杜鹃形成层活动的 主要气象因子，且存在限制其木质部分化开始的大气（2.0{$\pm$}0.6\textdegree C）和土壤（6.0{$\pm$}0.7\textdegree C）低温阈值。 （5）与两林线树种相比，限制薄毛海绵杜鹃木质部分化的低温阈值相对较高，这一差异与其较晚的生长开始日期有关。基于这一低温阈值，薄毛海绵杜鹃灌木线 (海拔4600米)处生长季仅为2个月左右 (以气温递减率6.0/100米推算)。 上述研究结果表明，林线乔木形成层活动与高山灌木具有相似的气候限制因子，即最低气温；并且，存在限制林线乔木与高山灌木木质部分化开始的低温阈值，它们保证了林线乔木及高山灌木完成整个木质部分化过程的最短时间需求，说明气温和生长季长度是限制典型湿润区高林线形成的两个重要因素；与林线乔木相比，限制高山灌木木质部分化的低温阈值较高，表明高山灌木较林线乔木具有的主要功能优势与其物候适应（特别生长开始时间）有关。土壤温度阈值的存在也暗示了高山灌木具有规避生长季早期低温胁迫的能力，这为理解高山林线形成机制提供了新的解释。},

How will the high-elevation ecosystems cope with such changing conditions? This study aims to combine cambial phenology with quantitative wood anatomy to understand how the growth dynamics affect the trade-off between safety and efficiency of water transport in the Himalayan forests. We investigated the timing of xylogenesis and its relationship with hydraulic wood anatomical traits in Himalayan birch (Betula utilis D. Don) at two altitudes in the central Himalayas. Xylogenesis was monitored weekly from April to September 2014 by collecting microcores. We measured vessel area on histological sections, calculated the hydraulic diameter, and assessed the effects of climate on xylem production rate. Xylogenesis occurred from June to September in both study sites. Moisture availability influenced positively xylem growth besides thermal conditions. The onset and duration of vessel enlargement were correlated with the hydraulic diameter. Trees with earlier onsets and longer durations of vessel enlargement exhibited larger hydraulic diameters. The close relationship between cambial phenology and hydraulic diameter suggests that earlier growth resumption induced by climate changes may result in larger vessels, which are more efficient in water transport, but vulnerable to drought-induced cavitation. The ongoing warming and drying climate conditions may menace the survival of birch forest in the central Himalayas.},

Conifer species face strong environmental filters due to climatic seasonality. Investigating how conifers change their hydraulic architecture during xylem development across the season may shed light on possible mechanisms underlying hydraulic adaptation in conifers. Laser microscopy was used to assess the three-dimensional hydraulic architecture of balsam fir ( Abies balsamea (Linnaeus) Miller), jack pine ( Pinus banksiana Lambert), white spruce ( Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), and black spruce ( Picea mariana (Miller) Britton, Sterns \& Poggenburgh) seedlings. We measured hydraulic-related xylem traits from early to latewood, during four years of plant growth. The xylem development of jack pine seedlings contrasts with the other species for keeping torus overlap (a hydraulic safety-associated xylem trait), relatively constant across the season (from early to latewood) and the years. The tracheids and torus expansion are positively associated with plant growth. Pit aperture-torus covariance is central to the seasonal dynamics of jack pine xylem development, which jointly with a rapid tracheid and pit expansion seems to boost its growth performance. Linking xylem structural changes during xylem development with hydraulics is a major issue for future research to assess conifers vulnerability to climate change.},

  abstract = {Three methods were used to distinguish the characteristics of changes in climate variability and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) during the period from 1982 to 2000 in China. Great changes in climate variability and an increased trend in NDVI were observed. The changes in precipitation variability were greater than the changes in temperature variability in each month, which is attributed to changes in the monsoon system in East Asia. The abrupt changes in climate and NDVI were more significant in 1983 than in the other years due to the impacts of El Nin\texttildelow{} o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Using these results, the influences of changes in climate variability on vegetation were studied in the whole nation, and eight regions were defined according to the vegetation division map of China. The results show that abrupt climate changes at a small scale cannot cause abrupt NDVI changes directly. At a nationwide level, over a longer time scale the persistence of above/below average temperature determines the changes in NDVI; at a shorter time scale, changes in the magnitude of precipitation influence NDVI significantly. Such regional climate variability affects vegetation in different ways owing to the diversity of vegetation types, climatic conditions and topography of the land.},

Most studies investigating these threats have focused on changes in species richness or species diversity. However, if we are to understand the absolute and long-term effects of anthropogenic impacts on tropical forests, we should also consider the interactions between species, how those species are organized in networks, and the function that those species perform. I discuss our current knowledge of network structure and ecosystem functioning, highlighting empirical examples of their response to anthropogenic impacts. I consider the future prospects for tropical forest biodiversity, focusing on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in secondary forest.

The intermediate data - which can be corrected using an independent measurement of density (ratio weight/volume of the whole sample) - are then computed for each ring profile. Finally, each ring is described by several synthetic values: the ring width, the mean density, the minimal and maximal density, the earlywood and latewood widths and ratios, and a set of density values (named quantiles ) describing the shape of the ring profile.Le traitement des donnees obtenues par l'analyse microdensitometrique d'eprouvettes en bois tel qu'il est pratique a l'Inra est detaille et discute.

  abstract = {Animal foraging has been characterized as an attempt to maximize the intake of carbon and nitrogen at appropriate ratios. Plant species in over 90 families produce carbohydrate-rich extrafloral nectar (EFN), a resource attractive to ants and other omnivorous insects. This attraction can benefit the plant if those arthropods subsequently attack herbivores. This protective response has been attributed to the increased visitation and ``ownership'' of plants that provide a predictable source of fuel. Here, we propose and test an alternative (but non-mutually exclusive) hypothesis, that access to C-rich carbohydrates increases the ants' desire for N-rich protein and hence the likelihood that they will attack herbivorous insects on the host plant. This ``deficit hypothesis'' would be rejected if (1) EFN were itself a sufficiently balanced food source in terms of C and N, (2) ant dietary preferences were similar in the presence vs. absence of EFN, (3) protein-hungry ants were not more predaceous, or (4) ants provided access to protein were more aggressive toward potential prey items than were ants provided access to carbohydrates. We test these predictions in a protective mutualism between a guild of desert ants and the barrel cactus Ferocactus wislizeni. C:N ratios of EFN exceeded that of ants or potential prey items by an order of magnitude (i.e., EFN is an N-poor food for ants). Baiting studies demonstrated that plant-tending ant species recruited more workers to N-rich protein baits than to C-rich sugar baits; this difference was more pronounced when the ants had access to F. wislizeni EFN. From these data, we infer that protein is a valuable resource and that its relative value increases when carbohydrates are readily available. Moreover, ant colonies provided access to supplemental carbohydrates responded more aggressively to surrogate herbivores than did control colonies (to which no additional resources were provided) or colonies provided protein. These results support the predictions of the ``deficit'' hypothesis, wherein plant protection is elicited by plant-mediated dietary imbalances.},

  abstract = {The evolution of territorial behavior requires that the benefits of territoriality outweigh the costs. The costs are primarily those of territorial defense against encroaching neighbors or against floaters seeking to establish their own territory. One way to reduce the cost of defense might be to restrict serious conflict to encounters with those posing the greatest threat. Studies of many animals have found that less aggression is shown toward neighbors than toward strangers, a phenomenon known as the ``dear enemy'' effect. However, the opposite can also be true, namely, that more aggression is shown toward neighbors than strangers: the ``nasty neighbor'' effect. This may be particularly true of group-living species that defend a resource-based territory. Here we show that (1) colonies of the weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina were able to recognize a greater proportion of workers from neighboring colonies as non-colony members; and (2) when recognized as non-colony members, more aggression was exhibited toward neighbors than non-neighbors. We present for the first time evidence that differential levels of aggression involve both a perceptual and behavioral component. On the other hand, we found no evidence that weaver ant workers were better able to recognize workers from previously unknown colonies or responded more aggressively to them, even after a 10-day period of contact. This contrasts with other species in which rapid learning of the identity of new potential enemies has been demonstrated. We suggest that such a response is unnecessary for weaver ants, as encounters with intruders from non-neighboring colonies are probably rare and of little consequence. This study adds to the growing body of evidence that the nasty neighbor effect may be much more common than the dear enemy effect among group-living species.},

Here, we paralleled dendroclimatic analyses with hydraulics measurements in co-occurring Larix olgensis and Pinus koraiensis trees along an elevational gradient (low, middle and high) in Northeast China. We aimed to detect potential differences in patterns of growth and responses to climate warming between the two conifer species considering their distinctions in life history strategy and key functional traits and to provide a mechanistic explanation for such differences. Our tree-ring analyses showed that L. olgensis trees exhibited a linear increase in basal area increment at the initial part of lifetime while Korean pine trees usually have a long slow growth period up to several decades at the juvenile stage. Consistent with their contrasts in growth rate, the larch species showed significantly higher hydraulic conductivity and func\- tional traits favoring more efficient carbon gain at the shoot level compared to sympatric Korean pine trees. Results of the dendroclimatological analyses indicate that temperature rather than precipitation is the controlling factor for growth in both species under the current climate regime. Radial growth of both species overall accelerated accompanying the rapid warming since 1990s except a significant decrease in growth for Korean pine trees at the low elevation site, which is likely due to stronger competitions from co-occurring broadleaf trees in the mixed forest environments. In the larch species, the substantially lower degree of response in growth at the low elevation site compared to trees at higher elevations suggests that the drying effect of warming at the low elevation may have to a certain degree offset the beneficial effects of warming on growth of larch trees.},

As plant-\-derived resources are essential components of ant diets, plants that offer more nutritious food to ants should be better defended in return, as a result of more aggressive behavior toward natural enemies. We tested this hypothesis in a field experiment by adding artificial nectaries to individuals of the species Vochysia elliptica (Vochysiaceae). Ants were offered one of four liquid foods of different nutritional quality: amino acids, sugar, sugar + amino acids, and water (control). We used live termites (Nasutitermes coxipoensis) as herbivore competitors and observed ant behavior toward them. In 88 hr of observations, we recorded 1,009 interactions with artificial nectaries involving 1,923 individual ants of 26 species. We recorded 381 encounters between ants and termites, of which 38\% led to attack. Sixty-\-one percent of these attacks led to termite exclusion from the plants. Recruitment and patrolling were highest when ants fed upon nectaries providing sugar + amino acids, the most nutritious food. This increase in recruitment and patrolling led to higher encounter rates between ants and termites, more frequent attacks, and faster and more complete termite removal. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that plant biotic defense is mediated by resource quality. We highlight the importance of qualitative differences in nectar composition for the outcome of ant\textendash plant interactions.},

In these montane systems, the effects of environmental changes on tree growth are also modified by elevation itself, thus complicating our ability to predict effects of future climate change. Tree-ring analysis along an elevation gradient allows quantifying effects of gradual and annual environmental changes. Here, we study long-term physiological (ratio of internal to ambient CO2, i.e., Ci/Ca and intrinsic water-use efficiency, iWUE) and growth responses (treering width) of Himalayan fir (Abies spectabilis) trees in response to warming, drying, and CO2 rise. Our study was conducted along elevational gradients in a dry and a wet region in the central Himalaya. We combined dendrochronology and stable carbon isotopes ({$\delta$}13C) to quantify long-term trends in Ci/Ca ratio and iWUE ({$\delta$}13C-derived), growth (mixed-effects models), and evaluate climate sensitivity (correlations). We found that iWUE increased over time at all elevations, with stronger increase in the dry region. Climate\textendash growth relations showed growth-limiting effects of spring moisture (dry region) and summer temperature (wet region), and negative effects of temperature (dry region). We found negative growth trends at lower elevations (dry and wet regions), suggesting that continental-scale warming and regional drying reduced tree growth. This interpretation is supported by {$\delta$}13C-derived long-term physiological responses, which are consistent with responses to reduced moisture and increased vapor pressure deficit. At high elevations (wet region), we found positive growth trends, suggesting that warming has favored tree growth in regions where temperature most strongly limits growth. At lower elevations (dry and wet regions), the positive effects of CO2 rise did not mitigate the negative effects of warming and drying on tree growth. Our results raise concerns on the productivity of Himalayan fir forests at low and middle ({$<$}3,300 m) elevations as climate change progresses.},

Yet, beyond these interactions is a less obvious but arguably as significant impact: through their collective ecological pressure, ants have imposed survivorship bias on the species that we observe inhabiting terrestrial environments. If life on land has passed through an ant-shaped selective filter, it is imperative we understand how these insects have sculpted ecological communities and are enmeshed within them. Here, we describe how ants have shaped biodiversity, and the often-devastating consequences of humanity's impact on these social insects.},

  abstract = {Variations in tree-ring structure from pith to bark of mature Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst. (L)) grown under contrasting climate conditions (warm-dry vs. cool-humid) in south-western Germany were investigated. Sample trees were from even-aged stands where no intensive silvicultural treatments had taken place. The cell number (CN), diameter (CD), lumen diameter (CL) and wall thickness (CW) were measured from stem cross-sections taken at breast height. A raw data chronology of each cell parameter was established for the whole annual ring (AR), earlywood (EW), latewood (LW), and transition wood (TW). The long-term trends of the cell parameters were generally nonlinear, parameter-specific in AR and EW and similar over sites. Those in LW were site-specific and similar over cell parameters. The variation of the same parameter, expressed by the coefficient of variance (CV), tended to increase from EW towards LW and was clearly higher for CN than for other cell parameters of all tree-ring zones. Trees from the warm-dry site had more LW cells and substantially thicker CW, whereas those from the cool-humid site had larger EW cells. These observed differences are likely due to the hydraulic adaptation mechanisms of trees to different site conditions.},

  abstract = {The ant species of genus Oecophylla shows unexpected social behavior (eusociality). Our present study reveals the development of nests, protective behavior and foraging behavior by O. smaragdina. According to the studies, a single nest has different types of castes that help to build a nest. We studied several nests during summer ({$>$}42\textdegree C). The castes: workers, drones and queens constitute the nest. The queen during their nuptial flight, mate with the male and comes back to the nest for laying eggs. The worker ants squeeze the fluid (lac/silk) from unfertilized eggs of drone larva at the periphery for sealing the leaves. In our study, we have also focused on possessiveness of ants towards their colony mates. It has been observed that once their colony is disturbed they begin to migrate to other places of same or different tree to prepare a new shelter for them. The queens in the colony feed up on insects captured by workers. Ants obtain their food with the help of other nest mates by a specialized activity known as ``foraging''. It is well adapted by ants and it is achieved by special group called foragers. Together with food, they generally march towards their own nest rather than moving to others nest conforming nest specificity. In this study, we have considered O.smaragdina. From the study, we have concluded that O.smaragdina show eusociality for nest building, protecting and foraging behavior.},

  abstract = {In many agroecosystems, the implementation of an integrated pest management (IPM) program against mealybugs (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) is undermined by the presence of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). In a mutualistic association, ants obtain carbohydrates from the mealybugs in the form of honeydew and, in exchange, protect the mealybugs against their natural enemies. Ants however also need protein in their diet. Thus, they can also prey on the mealybugs, especially when their carbohydrates requirements are met. This study aims to assess whether providing ants with sugar-feeders (representing ad libitum sources of carbohydrates) i) alters their mutualistic re\- lationships with the mealybugs (ant tending), ii) increases the parasitism of mealybugs, iii) increases ant predation rate and iv) alters the protein and carbohydrate profile in ant workers. For this study, we selected a citrus orchard with high infestation levels of the mealybug Planoccocus citri tended by the ant Lasius grandis. Our results showed that sugar provisioning reduced ant activity and ant tending, resulting in an increase of mealybug parasitism rates. Ants showed a tendency to prey more sentinel preys in trees with sugar-feeders, even though the differences were not significant. The gut content in terms of carbohydrates and proteins of ant workers did not differ among trees with and without sugar-feeders. Overall, our results show that sugar provisioning can be used for improving pest management strategies against mealybugs; while further research is necessary to corroborate that predation by ants of honeydew producers increases when sugar-feeders are provided.},

Over the past decade, experts in transdisciplinary research have developed numerous principles, methods, and tools for making  research more societally relevant. If researchers are unfamiliar with transdisciplinary research, they may miss opportunities to adapt these principles and tools to their research projects. We are developing a 10-step approach for joint use by transdisciplinarity experts and researchers about  how to best align their research projects with the requirements of transdisciplinarity. We have successfully applied this approach in numerous workshops, summer schools, and seminars at ETH Zurich and beyond. Ten questions guide discussions between transdisciplinarity experts and researchers  around research issues, identify and review the societal problems addressed, identify relevant actors and disciplines, and clarify the purpose and form of the interaction with them. The feedback we have obtained clearly indicates that the 10-step approach is a very useful tool: It provides  a systematic procedure for thinking through ways to better link research to societal problem solving. 【摘要翻译】虽然跨学科研究的目标是与社会相关，但完成这一目标的具体指示仍然是隐含的。我们建议通过10步方法改善这种情况，这种方法旨在鼓励对使研究更具社会相关性的方法进行明确的思考。今天，越来越需要研究人员证明他们的研究可以为社会带来的实际价值。在过去的十年里，跨学科研究领域的专家们已经发展出许多原则、方法和工具，使研究更具社会相关性。如果研究人员不熟悉跨学科研究，他们可能会错过机会，以适应这些原则和工具，以他们的研究项目。我们正在开发一个10步方法，供跨学科研究的专家和研究人员共同使用，以便使他们的研究项目最好地符合跨学科研究的要求。我们已经成功地将这种方法应用于许多研讨会、暑期学校、苏黎世联邦理工学院的研讨会等等。10个问题指导跨学科研究的专家和研究人员围绕研究问题进行讨论，识别和回顾所涉及的社会问题，确定相关的行为者和学科，并澄清与他们互动的目的和形式。我们得到的反馈清楚地表明，10步方法是一个非常有用的工具: 它提供了一个系统的程序，用于思考如何更好地将研究与解决社会问题联系起来。},

In this study, a total of 394 reflectance spectra (between 350 and 2500 nm) from foliage branches or canopy of 11 important urban forest broadleaf species were measured in the City of Tampa, Florida, USA with a spectrometer. The 11 species include American elm (Ulmus americana), bluejack oak (Quercus incana), crape myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica), laurel oak (Q. laurifolia), live oak (Q. virginiana), southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), red maple (Acer rubrum), sand live oak (Q. geminata), American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), and turkey oak (Q. laevis). A total of 46 spectral variables, including normalized spectra, derivative spectra, spectral vegetation indices, spectral position variables, and spectral absorption features were extracted and analysed from the in situ hyperspectral measurements. Two classification algorithms were used to identify the 11 broadleaf species: a nonlinear artificial neural network (ANN) and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates that the 30 selected spectral variables are effective to differentiate the 11 species. The 30 selected spectral variables account for water absorption features at 970, 1200, and 1750 nm and reflect characteristics of pigments and other biochemicals in tree leaves, especially variability of chlorophyll content in leaves. The experimental results indicate that both classification algorithms (ANN and LDA) have produced acceptable accuracies (overall accuracy from 86.3\% to 87.8\%, kappa from 0.83 to 0.87) and have a similar performance for classifying the 11 broadleaf species with input of the 30 selected spectral variables. The preliminary results of identifying the 11 species with the in situ hyperspectral data imply that with current remote sensing techniques, including high spatial and spectral resolution data, it is still difficult but possible to identify similar species to such 11 broadleaf species with an acceptable accuracy.},

We represent shape constrained model components by mildly non-linear extensions of P-splines. Models can contain multiple shape constrained and unconstrained terms as well as shape constrained multi-dimensional smooths. The constraints considered are on the sign of the first or/and the second derivatives of the smooth terms. A key advantage of the approach is that it facilitates efficient estimation of smoothing parameters as an integral part of model estimation, via GCV or AIC, and numerically robust algorithms for this are presented. We also derive simulation free approximate Bayesian confidence intervals for the smooth components, which are shown to achieve close to nominal coverage probabilities. Applications are presented using real data examples including the risk of disease in relation to proximity to municipal incinerators and the association between air pollution and health.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, the pervasive question of climate change impacts on forests has revived investigations on intra-annual dynamics of wood formation, involving disciplines such as plant ecology, tree physiology and dendrochronology. This resulted in the creation of many research groups working on this topic worldwide and a rapid increase in the number of studies and publications. Wood-formation-monitoring studies are generally based on a common conceptual model describing xylem cell formation as the succession of four differentiation phases (cell division, cell enlargement, cell wall thickening and mature cells). They generally use the same sampling techniques, sample preparation methods and anatomical criteria to separate between differentiation zones and discriminate and count forming xylem cells, resulting in very similar raw data. However, the way these raw data are then processed, producing the elaborated data on which statistical analyses are performed, still remains quite specific to each individual study. Thereby, despite very similar raw data, wood-formation-monitoring studies yield results that are still quite difficult to compare. CAVIAR\textemdash an R package specifically dedicated to the verification, visualization and manipulation of wood-formationmonitoring data\textemdash can help to improve this situation. Initially, CAVIAR was built to provide efficient algorithms to compute critical dates of wood formation phenology for conifers growing in temperate and cold environments. Recently, we developed it further to check, display and process wood-formation-monitoring data. Thanks to new and upgraded functions, raw data can now be consistently verified, standardized and modelled (using logistic regressions and Gompertz functions), in order to describe wood phenology and intra-annual dynamics of tree-ring formation. We believe that CAVIAR will help strengthening the science of wood formation dynamics by effectively contributing to the standardization of its concepts and methods, making thereby possible the comparison between data and results from different studies.},

Radial and tangential tracheid diameters decline from earlywood to latewood by 50\% and 15\%, respectively. At the same time, radial and tangential cell-wall thicknesses increase by 110\% and 132\%, respectively. Wood density exhibits an S-shape profile with a slight decrease of 10\% at the beginning of a ring and an increase of 212\% thereafter. Model simulations showed that wood density increase is mainly due to cell-wall thickening in tangential and radial directions as well as cell size reduction in radial direction. Simulations also showed that the knowledge of tracheid anatomical characteristics is not sufficient to fully explain wood density decrease at the beginning of earlywood.},

  abstract = {Studies of intra-annual dynamics of cambial activity and wood formation share very similar data because they are based on classic concepts of xylem development and well-documented techniques of sample preparation. However, the way the data are produced is specific to each study or group of authors because there is not a real agreement or consensus about critical variable definitions and data processing. The consequence is that despite very similar data, these studies are difficult to compare. In order to improve this point, we proposed objective definitions of the main phenological events (critical dates) occurring during wood formation, i.e. the beginning and ending of the cell enlarging and maturing phases and the beginning of the cell mature phase. The beginning of a given phase was defined as the date at which 50\% of the observed radial files show at least one first cell in this phase, while the end of a given phase was defined as the date at which 50\% of the observed radial files show at most one last cell in this phase. Dedicated R package CAVIAR was developed in order to apply these definitions to the computation of critical dates, as well as to their visualisation and analysis. Several statistical tests (Student's t-test, Wilcoxon's rank sum test and bootstrap tests on means and medians) were evaluated for comparing critical dates between two groups. Based on theoretical considerations and on study case analyses, it was shown that the bootstrap test on median is the best-suited statistical test for comparing critical dates when considering the peculiarities of the data at hand. Finally, the application of the presented definitions and methods was illustrated by the study of a real dataset obtained from five silver firs and five Scots pines grown under the same conditions and sampled weekly during the 2006 vegetation period. The results of this application showed that wood formation in pines started earlier, finished later and lasted longer than in firs, as documented by previous studies. We believe that the development of such objective definitions accompanied by ready-to-use tools for data processing, analysis and visualisation will reinforce the discipline by contributing efficiently to standardise concepts and methodologies.},

Due to technical improvements a temporal resolution of 7 rain could be reached and flow measurements could be performed over a time course of 12-30 h. The novel method was applied to the hypocotyl of 35- to 40-day-old, leafy plants of Ricinus comrnunis which were subjected to different light-dark regimes.The results showed that the xylem flow velocities and the xylem volume flow responded immediately to light on-off changes. Upon illumination the flowvelocity and the volume flow increased as expected in respect to literature. In contrast, the phloem flow velocity did not change in response to the light-dark regimes. Interestingly, though, the volume flow in the phloem increased during darkness. These findings can be explained by assuming that the conducting area of the phloem becomes enlarged during the dark period due to opening of sieve pores.},

This includes accurate estimations of the rate and duration of the cell enlargement and wall thickening phases. This paper presents an application where the Gompertz equation is used to calculate cell number increase and to estimate both the rates and periods of the differentiation phases on a daily scale during the growing season. Tests were performed on two coniferous species, Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. and Pinus cembra L., growing in the Canadian boreal forest and on the Italian Alpine treeline respectively. Wood micro-cores, including the most recent tree-rings, were collected during the growing season of 2001. Cross-sections were cut with a microtome and stained with cresyl fast violet to differentiate xylem cells of the growing tree-ring. The number of cells within the zones of radial cell enlargement, secondary wall thickening and mature xylem were counted. The normalised cell number increases were fitted into a Gompertz function [y = f(t)]. The results showed that the function provided suitable descriptions of the cell increase for both Abies balsamea and Pinus cembra with R2 ranging between 0.60 and 0.90. Subsequently, to assess the development phases in time, the Gompertz equation was expressed in function of the independent variable [t = f(y)]. The use of only one equation for the estimation of both cell division and differentiation throughout the vegetative season has demonstrated to be an important improvement.},

This study investigated the causal relationships in cambium phenology of black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP] monitored for 8 years on four sites of the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. The dependency links connecting the timing of xylem cell differentiation and cell production were defined and the resulting causal model was analysed with d-sep tests and generalized mixed models with repeated measurements, and tested with Fisher's C statistics to determine whether and how causality propagates through the measured variables. The higher correlations were observed between the dates of emergence of the first developing cells and between the ending of the differentiation phases, while the number of cells was significantly correlated with all phenological phases. The model with eight dependency links was statistically valid for explaining the causes and correlations between the dynamics of cambium phenology. Causal modelling suggested that the phenological phases involved in xylogenesis are closely interconnected by complex relationships of cause and effect, with the onset of cell differentiation being the main factor directly or indirectly triggering all successive phases of xylem maturation.},

As trees use much of the allocated carbon gained from photosynthesis to produce branches and stems, information on the timing and dynamics of secondary wood growth is crucial to assessing temperature thresholds for xylogenesis. We have carried out histological analyses to determine cambial activity and xylem cell differentiation in conifers growing at the treeline on the eastern Alps in two sites during 2002\textendash 2004 with the aim of linking the growth process with temperature and, consequently, of defining thresholds for xylogenesis. Cambial activity occurred from May to July\textendash August and cell differentiation from May\textendash June to September\textendash October. The earliest start of radial enlargement was observed in stone pine in mid-May, while Norway spruce was the last species to begin tracheid differentiation. The duration of wood formation varied from 90 to 137 days, depending on year and site, with no difference between species. Longer durations were observed in trees on the south-facing site because of the earlier onset and later ending of cell production and differentiation. The threshold temperatures at which xylogenesis had a 0.5 probability of being active were calculated by logistic regressions. Xylogenesis was active when the mean daily air temperature was 5.6\textendash 8.5\textdegree C and mean stem temperature was 7.2\textendash 9\textdegree C.},

The phenological traits of cambium activity and xylem formation were analyzed at a short time scale along a thermal gradient represented by an alti-latitudinal range from the 48th to 53rd parallels and covering the whole closed black-spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP] forest in Quebec, Canada. A hypothesis was tested that warmer temperatures influence cambium phenology, allowing longer duration and higher intensity of growth, and resulting in proportionally increased xylem production. From April to October 2012, cell division in cambium and post-cambial differentiation of xylem were observed on anatomical sections obtained from microcores collected weekly from the stem of fifty trees. The southern and warmer site was characterized by the highest radial growth, which corresponded to both the highest rates and longest durations of cell production. The differences in terms of xylem phenology and growth were marginal between the other sites. Xylem growth was positively correlated with rate and duration of cell production, with the latter explaining most variability in growth. Within the range analyzed, the relationship between temperature and most phenological phases of xylogenesis was linear. On the contrary, temperature was related with cell production according to an exponential pattern. Periods of xylogenesis of 14 days longer (+13.1\%) corresponded to a massive increase in cell production (33 cells, +109\%). This disproportionate change occurred at a May\textendash September average temperature of ca. 14 \textdegree{} C and a snow-free period of 210\textendash 235 days. At the lower boundary of the distribution of black spruce, small environmental changes allowing marginal lengthening of the period of cell division could potentially lead to disproportionate increases in xylem cell production, with substantial consequences for the productivity of this boreal species.},

The phenological events and mean annual temperature of the sites were related linearly, with spring and autumnal events being separated by constant intervals across the range of temperature analysed. At increasing temperature, first enlarging, wall-thickening and mature tracheids appeared earlier, and last enlarging and wall-thickening tracheids occurred later. Overall, the period of wood formation lengthened linearly with the mean annual temperature, from 83.7 days at \`A2 \textdegree C to 178.1 days at 12 \textdegree C, at a rate of 6.5 days \textdegree C\`A1. April\textendash May temperatures produced the best models predicting the dates of wood formation. Our findings demonstrated the uniformity of the process of wood formation and the importance of the environmental conditions occurring at the time of growth resumption. Under warming scenarios, the period of wood formation might lengthen synchronously in the cold biomes of the Northern Hemisphere.},

  abstract = {In the next century, the boreal ecosystems are projected to experience greater rates of warming than most other regions of the world. As the boreal forest constitutes a reservoir of trees of huge ecological importance and only partially known economic potential, any possible climate-related change in plant growth and dynamics has to be promptly predicted and evaluated. A model for assessing xylem phenology in black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.] using daily temperatures and thermal thresholds was defined and applied to predict changes in onset, ending and duration of xylem growth under different warming scenarios with temperatures rising by up to 3 1C. This was achieved by collecting and analyzing a dataset obtained from a 7-year monitoring of cambium phenology and wood formation on a weekly time-scale in trees growing in four sites at different latitudes and altitudes in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region (Quebec, Canada). The onset of xylem growth occurred between mid-May and early June while the end ranged between mid-September and early October, resulting in a growing season of 101\textendash 141 days. The model predicted longer duration of xylem growth at higher temperatures, with an increase of 8\textendash 11 days/ 1C, because of an earlier onset and later ending of growth. With an increase of 3 1C in the mean temperature during the year, the duration of xylem growth changed on average from 125 to 160 days. The predicted changes in cambial phenology could significantly affect future wood production of the boreal ecosystems.},

In order to be minimally invasive, wood samples are extracted as microcores. Despite the research done on xylem cell development and the increasing interest in intra-annual studies of xylogenesis, few tools are available for microcore sampling. Methods originally designed for other purposes have often been used, but no details are available on their efficiency and usefulness. Information is also lacking on laboratory preparation techniques for cell analysis of tree-ring formation, leading to difficulties in carrying out these experiments. The advantages and limits of the tools used up to now are described. A new tool, named Trephor (patent pending n\textdegree{} PD2004A000324), specifically designed for long-lasting use is presented. Trephor is chisel-shaped for a fast recovery of 2 mm diameter microcores. The cutting tube is inserted into the wood using a hammer and no other accessory is required. Simple technical characteristics allow high quality samples to be collected from both softwood and hardwood species with minimum damage to the sampled trees. Trephor was tested during the 2004 growing season, demonstrating good resistance to wear and tear and mechanical stress. Embedding the microcores in paraffin for fast section preparation is described.},

  abstract = {Summary. Aggression assays are commonly used to study nestmate recognition in social insects. Methods range from detailed behavioral observations on small numbers of insects to counts of individuals fighting in group interactions. These assays vary in the equipment used and the intensity and duration of observations. We used the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, to compare four aggression bioassays for consistency between replicates, similarity between assays, and ability to predict whole colony interactions. The assays included were 1 live \textendash{} 1 dead ant interactions, live 1-1 battles, live 5-5 battles, and 1 ant introduced to a foreign colony. We tested six ant colonies in all pairwise combinations using four different assays and two to three scoring methods per assay. We also conducted a colony merging experiment to see which assays were capable of predicting this ecologically important event. We found that scoring methods within assays yielded very similar results, giving us no reason to favor observationally intense procedures, such as continuous scanning, over less observationally intense systems, such as snapshot surveys. Assays differed greatly in their consistency between replicates. No two replicates of the 1 live \textendash 1 dead assay were significantly correlated. The live 5-5 and the colony introduction assays were the most consistent across replicates. The mean scores of the live 1-1, live 5-5 and colony introduction assays were all significantly correlated with each other; only the live 5-5 assay was significantly correlated with the 1 live \textendash{} 1 dead assay. Assays that utilized the greatest number of live ants were the most likely to reveal high levels of aggression. The aggression scores of all but the 1 live \textendash{} 1 dead assay were positively correlated with the number of ants that died during whole colony encounters and negatively associated with colony merging. We conclude that all live ant assays tested are useful tools for analyzing aggressive interactions between colonies, but that the pairing of a live and dead ant produced inconsistent results and generally lower levels of aggression. We found relatively low consistency between trials using the live 1-1 assay, but found that with sufficient replication its results were highly correlated with the assays using more interacting ants. We suggest that isolated aggressive acts in assays do not necessarily predict whole colony interactions: some colonies that fought in bioassays merged when the entire colonies were allowed to interact.},

We used bootstrapped response functions to identify the variables controlling growth, and we estimated the pure and shared effects of local climate components (temperature and water balance) and a large-scale atmospheric pattern (North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO) on tree growth using a variance partitioning approach. For all species, the response functions showed stronger climatic signals in latewood and total ring than in earlywood. The pure effects of temperature, water balance, and NAO on tree growth were significant. However, a null shared effect between local climate and NAO was evidenced due to the absence of a direct link between NAO in the previous autumn and the other significant climatic variables. Pinus pinaster was the species most sensitive to local climate, mainly to water availability during its active period as a consequence of higher water use efficiency. Quercus growth was negatively influenced by winter temperature, and growth of P. pinea and both Quercus species was inversely related to NAO in the previous autumn. The obtained results suggest that Q. robur and Q. pyrenaica have similar growth behaviour and climatic sensitivity. However, both P. pinea and P. pinaster showed contrasting growth dynamics and sensitivity in this Atlantic littoral island, despite their common Mediterranean origin.},

  abstract = {Ants are a dominant feature of terrestrial ecosystems, yet we know little about the forces that drive their evolution. Recent findings illustrate that their diets range from herbivorous to predaceous, with ``herbivores'' feeding primarily on exudates from plants and sap-feeding insects. Persistence on these nitrogen-poor food sources raises the question of how ants obtain sufficient nutrition. To investigate the potential role of symbiotic microbes, we have surveyed 283 species from 18 of the 21 ant subfamilies using molecular techniques. Our findings uncovered a wealth of bacteria from across the ants. Notable among the surveyed hosts were herbivorous ``turtle ants'' from the related genera               Cephalotes               and               Procryptocerus               (tribe Cephalotini). These commonly harbored bacteria from ant-specific clades within the               Burkholderiales               ,               Pseudomonadales               ,               Rhizobiales               ,               Verrucomicrobiales               , and               Xanthomonadales               , and studies of lab-reared               Cephalotes varians               characterized these microbes as symbiotic residents of ant guts. Although most of these symbionts were confined to turtle ants, bacteria from an ant-specific clade of               Rhizobiales               were more broadly distributed. Statistical analyses revealed a strong relationship between herbivory and the prevalence of               Rhizobiales               gut symbionts within ant genera. Furthermore, a consideration of the ant phylogeny identified at least five independent origins of symbioses between herbivorous ants and related               Rhizobiales               . Combined with previous findings and the potential for symbiotic nitrogen fixation, our results strongly support the hypothesis that bacteria have facilitated convergent evolution of herbivory across the ants, further implicating symbiosis as a major force in ant evolution.},

  abstract = {Analysis of a tree ring is the primary method for determining the growth and age of a tree. In a microdestructive tree-ring measurement system, the tree under test is drilled with a microdrill at a constant rotating speed to detect the difference in density between the early and late wood, thereby realizing a microdestructive measurement of the tree-ring. The measurement system comprises a microdrill with a diameter of 3 mm, mechanical transmission, direct current (DC) servomotor, stepper motor, and control and detection circuit. The DC servomotor and stepper motor realize rotation and translation of the microdrill, respectively, through mechanical transmission. When the microdrill rotates and drills into the tree, the control and detection circuit samples and acquires the armature current of the DC servomotor, which is proportional to the resistance encountered by the drill bit and reflects the change in the density of the tree. The tree-ring number can be obtained by filtering the sampled original signals of the armature current using a finite impulse response (FIR) filtering algorithm. The annual rings of larch and fir tree discs were measured and tested using the designed system. It was observed that the average annual ring measurement accuracy of the larch discs reached 95.28\%, while that of the fir discs was 84.16\%. The diameter of the drill hole in the trunk was less than 3 mm after measuring the living wood, thereby achieving a microdestructive measurement of the tree-ring.},

Amino acid budgets for three aphid species, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.), Schizaphis graminum (Rondani) and Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko), were compared on a single host plant species, wheat Triticum aestivum L. Ingestion of amino acids from phloem, elimination of amino acids in honeydew, and the content of amino acids in aphids tissue were measured. From these values, ingestion rates were estimated and compared to honeydew and to estimated composition of aphid proteins. Ingestion rate was lowest in D. noxia due to low growth rate and low honeydew production; intermediate in S. graminum due to higher growth rate and intermediate honeydew production; and highest in R. padi, which had the highest rates for both variables. Both D. noxia and S. graminum induced increases in the amino acid content of ingested phloem. These changes in phloem content, combined with differences in ingestion rates, resulted in large differences among aphids in estimated rates of ingestion of individual amino acids. In honeydew, most essential amino acids were found in low amounts compared with the amounts ingested, especially for methionine and lysine. A few amino acids (arginine, cystine, histidine and tryptophan) were more abundant in honeydew of some aphids, suggesting oversupply. Aphid species differed in the composition of free amino acids in tissue but showed very similar composition in protein, implying similar requirements among the aphids. In R. padi and D. noxia, most essential amino acids were ingested in amounts insuf\textregistered cient for growth, implying dependence on symbiont provisioning.

The aim of this study was to analyze growth\textendash climate relationships for more than a century for a treeline ecotone in east-central Nepal and to test for Blue Intensity (BI; used as a surrogate of maximum late wood density) as climate proxy. We determined the relationships of Abies spectabilis radial tree growth and BI to climate by correlating both to temperature, precipitation and drought index data. The results showed a significantly unstable dendroclimatic signal over time. Climate warming-induced moisture deficits during pre-monsoon seasons became a major factor limiting radial tree growth during recent decades. Earlier in time, the dendroclimatic signal was weaker, predominantly reflecting a positive relationship of tree growth and summer temperature. Compared to radial tree growth, BI showed a different but strong climate signal. Temporally unstable correlations may be attributed to increasing effects of above-average rates of climate warming. An extended network of Himalayan tree-ring sites is needed to further analyze cause\textendash effect relationships and to solve this attribution problem.},

Although there has recently been increased research interest in xylem parenchyma cells, the mechanisms that operate in these cells are poorly understood. Therefore, the present review focuses on selected roles of xylem parenchyma and its relevance in wood functioning. In addition, to elucidate the importance of xylem parenchyma, we have compiled evidence supporting the hypothesis on the significance of parenchyma cells in tree functioning and identified the key unaddressed questions in the field.},

  abstract = {To understand how tree growth has responded to recent climate warming, an understanding of the tree\textendash climate\textendash site complex is necessary. To achieve this, radial growth variability among 204 trees established before 1850 was studied in relation to both climatic and site factors. Seventeen forest stands were sampled in the Spanish Central Pyrenees. Three species were studied: Pinus uncinata, Abies alba, and Pinus sylvestris. For each tree, a ring-width residual chronology was built. All trees cross-dated well, indicating a common influence of the regional climate. For the 1952\textendash 1993 period, the radial growth of all species, especially P. uncinata, was positively correlated with warm Novembers during the year before ring formation and warm Mays of the year the annual ring formed. Differences in species-stand elevation modulated the growth\textendash climate associations. Radial growth in P. uncinata at high elevation sites was reduced when May temperatures were colder and May precipitation more abundant. In the 20th century, two contrasting periods in radial growth were observed: one (1900\textendash 1949) with low frequency of narrow and wide rings, low mean annual sensitivity, and low common growth variation; and another (1950\textendash 1994) with the reverse characteristics. The increased variability in radial growth since the 1950s was observed for all species and sites, which suggests a climatic cause. The low shared variance among tree chronologies during the first half of the 20th century may result from a ``relaxation'' of the elevation gradient, allowing local site conditions to dominate macroclimatic influence. These temporal trends may be related to the recently reported increase of climatic variability and warmer conditions. This study emphasizes the need to carefully assess the relationships between radial growth and site conditions along ecological gradients to improve dendroclimatic reconstructions.},

  abstract = {A version of the nonparametric bootstrap, which resamples the entire subjects from original data, called the case bootstrap, has been increasingly used for estimating uncertainty of parameters in mixed-effects models. It is usually applied in order to get more robust estimates of the parameters and more realistic confidence intervals. Alternative bootstrap methods, such as residual bootstrap and parametric bootstrap which resample both random effects and residuals, have been proposed to better take into account the hierarchical structure of multi-level and longitudinal data. However, few studies have been done to compare these different approaches. In this study, we used simulation to evaluate bootstrap methods proposed for linear mixed-effect models. We also compared the results obtained by maximum likelihood (ML) and restricted maximum likelihood (REML). Our simulation studies evidenced the good performance of the case bootstrap as well as the bootstraps of both random effects and residuals. On the other hand, the bootstrap methods which resample only the residuals and the bootstraps combining case and residuals performed poorly. REML and ML provided similar bootstrap estimates of uncertainty, but there was slightly more bias and poorer coverage rate for variance parameters with ML in the sparse design. We applied the proposed methods to a real dataset from a study investigating the natural evolution of Parkinson's disease and were able to confirm the methods provide plausible estimates of uncertainty. Given that most real-life datasets tend to exhibit heterogeneity in sampling schedules, the residual bootstraps would be expected to perform better than the case bootstrap. 【摘要翻译】在混合效应模型中，用于估计参数不确定性的非参数自助法越来越多地被用来从原始数据中重新抽取整个受试者的数据，称为 case 自助法。为了得到更稳健的参数估计和更现实的置信区间，通常采用这种方法。为了更好地考虑纵向数据和多层次数据的层次结构，提出了重新抽取随机效应和残差的残差自助法和残差自助法。然而，很少有研究比较这些不同的方法。在本研究中，我们利用模拟来评估所提出的线性混合效应模型的自助法。我们还比较了最大似然法(ML)和限制性最大似然法(REML)的结果。我们的模拟研究证明了案例引导的良好性能，以及随机效应和残差的引导。另一方面，自举方法，只重采样的残差和自举结合案例和残差执行得很差。和 ML 提供了类似的不确定性的 bootstrap 估计，但是在稀疏设计中，ML 对方差参数的偏差略大，覆盖率较低。我们将所提出的方法应用到一个研究帕金森病自然进化的实际数据集中，并能够确认这些方法提供了合理的不确定性估计。考虑到大多数现实数据集在采样时间表上表现出异质性，剩余引导算子的性能要优于案例引导算子。},

  abstract = {Generalist predators bring a complex mix of beneficial and harmful effects to agroecosystems. When these predators feed on herbivorous pests, biological control is improved with the potential to increase crop yield. However, generalists often feed on predators, pollinators, and plants, which might worsen pest outbreaks and reduce fruit set. For example, weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) are major predators of several key, economically-damaging pest insects of tropical fruit and nut crops. Yet the ants also attack other predatory arthropods and important pollinators, while tending trophobiont honeydew producers like mealybugs (Pseudococcidae) that are themselves pests. Finally, ants will supplement their diet with sugars from floral and extrafloral nectaries, a form of plant feeding that presumably carries a physiological cost to the plant. Here, across previously-published experimental studies that compared treatments where ants were present vs. excluded, we summarize the effects of weaver ants on beneficial and pest insects and tree-crop productivity. Our quantitative review revealed nearly ubiquitous benefits of Oecophylla ants for tropical agriculture. Treatments with ants present generally showed lower pest densities and damage from pest insects in the families Coreidae, Miridae, Pentatomidae, and Tephritidae. Pest reduction was seen on cacao (Theobroma cacao), cashew (Anacardium occidentale), and mango (Mangifera indica) trees. The single exception to these pest reductions occurred when ants facilitated the population growth of mealybugs and other honeydew producers. In general, we found that Oecophylla ants provided the valuable ecosystem service of natural pest control to a diversity of tropical tree crops. Despite the potential for the ants to harm other predators or pollinators, evidence for these ecosystem disservices was rare and other beneficial insects co-exist well with this group of ants. Our findings bolster the general finding that ant species that tend herbivores who are not themselves pests can provide broad-reaching benefits to plant productivity. More generally, our findings are consistent with the many cases where non-pest prey bolster densities of polyphagous predators with benefits for biological control despite some degree of plant feeding by the predators.},

In this article, we present available sources of social media data and approaches to mining and analysing these data for conservation science.

  abstract = {Mediterranean trees and shrubs adjust physiological processes to ensure their functioning under shifting dry conditions. However, little is known about spatial and between-species differences in cambial dynamics and how their temporal variability determines climatic adaptability. We used the Vaganov-Shashkin process-based model to simulate five decades of daily cambial dynamics of coexisting junipers (shrubs/short-stature trees) and pines (tall trees) at two climatically contrasting continental sites in northeastern Spain. We hypothesized that different sites and growth forms may shift from unimodal to bimodal growth patterns, which in turn determines their ability to cope with climate stress. The model produced simulations coherent with ring-width chronologies, xylogenesis data and field monitoring of soil moisture. The model successfully captured differences in growth patterns between sites, but it was unable to highlight differences between coexisting species. The cambial dy\- namics of all the species were controlled by soil moisture in summer, resulting in bimodal or right-skewed unimodal growth patterns. Simulated cambial dynamics were strongly bimodal, with two distinct peaks in spring and autumn and frequent growth cessation during summer at the dry site with Juniperus thurifera and Pinus halepensis. The growth dynamics of both species at the cold site (Juniperus communis, Pinus uncinata) were rather right-skewed unimodal, suggesting reduced but continuous summer cambial activity. Species at the cold site responded to increasing moisture limitation over the last decades by earlier onset of cambial activity and increased spring cambial kinetics. The shifting of spring growth phenology and kinetics was less effective at the dry site, where both species reduced their growth during summer significantly. Our results suggest that growth adaptability on intra-annual scale determines the performance of woody plants under ongoing climate change in drought-prone regions. High responsiveness of cambial activity corroborates other physiological adaptations which jointly determine the climate-change resistance of junipers and pines.【摘要翻译】地中海的树木和灌木调整生理过程，以确保它们的功能在转移干燥条件下。然而，对于形成层动态的空间差异和种间差异以及它们的时间变异性如何决定气候适应性，人们知之甚少。我们使用基于 Vaganov-Shashkin 过程的模型模拟了西班牙东北部两个气候差异较大的大陆地区共存的刺柏(灌木/矮树)和松树(高树)50年的日形成层动态。我们假设不同的地点和生长方式可能会从单峰生长模式转变为双峰生长模式，这反过来决定了它们应对气候压力的能力。该模型产生的模拟与环宽年表、木聚糖生成数据和土壤湿度的实地监测相一致。该模型成功地捕捉到了不同地点之间生长模式的差异，但是它无法突出共存物种之间的差异。各物种的形成层动力学受夏季土壤水分的控制，形成双峰或右偏单峰生长模式。模拟的形成层动态是强烈的双峰型，春季和秋季出现两个明显的峰值，夏季频繁停止生长于松柏和地中海松的干燥地带。这两个物种在寒冷地区的生长动态(刺柏，赤松)是相当右倾斜的单峰型，表明夏季形成层活动减少但是持续。在过去的几十年里，寒冷地区的物种对不断增加的水分限制作出了反应，提前开始形成层活动，增加了春季形成层动力学。春季生长物候和动力学的变化在干旱地区效果不明显，夏季两种植物的生长都明显减弱。我们的研究结果表明，在年内尺度上的生长适应性决定了木本植物在持续气候变化下在干旱易发区的表现。形成层活动的高反应性也证实了其他生理适应性，这些生理适应性共同决定了杜松和松树的抗气候变化能力。},

A theoretical analysis of the equilibrium water-relations of individual cells of a twig is derived taking due account of the fact that each cell has a unique solute concentration, fluid volume, shape, and unique mechanical constraint by virtue of its cell-wall structure and attachment to nearest neighbours. These equations combine to give a complete description of the whole twig in response to mechanical (air pressure) stress. Our theoretical analysis suggests that the 'pressure-volume curve' can be related quantitatively to meaningful bulk parameters of water relations: viz. the total osmolar content of the symplast N,, the original volume of the symplast 1\^, the volume expressed from the symplast Ve, the gas-pressure of the bomb P, and the volume-averaged turgor pressure (the sum of the products of the relative volume and turgor pressure of each cell). An empirical relation for the volume-averaged turgor pressure of twigs is found which fits all species examined; it also fits the turgor pressure relation for single (Nitella) cells. 【摘要翻译】本文回顾了斯科兰德及其同事发展起来的压力弹技术。考虑到每个细胞由于其细胞壁结构和与邻近细胞的连接而具有独特的溶质浓度、液体体积、形状和独特的力学约束，导出了细枝各细胞平衡水关系的理论分析。这些方程组合起来给出了对机械(气压)应力作用下整个枝条的完整描述。我们的理论分析表明，``压力-体积曲线''可以定量地与有意义的水关系的体积参数相关: 即对称体 n 的总渗透率、对称体1 \^ 的原始体积、对称体表示的体积、弹体 p 的气体压力、体积平均膨胀压力(每个细胞的相对体积和膨胀压力的产物之和)。本文发现了适用于所有被检测物种的小枝体积平均膨胀压力的经验关系式，也适用于单细胞的膨胀压力关系式。},

  abstract = {In order to improve the estimation of carbon stored in the French forest biomass from National Forest Inventory data, we developed six speciesspecific equations for estimating the total aboveground volume of trees, including merchantable volume, branches and twigs. Equations use circumference at breast height and total height as independent variables. They were built from even-aged forests of the Landes massif, the northern half and the eastern mountain regions of France. The sample was selected within archives of volume measurements taken in growth and yield permanent plots between 1920 and 1955. It is made up of 4619 trees belonging to seven important species: 1222 Sessile Oak, 1293 Common Beech, 347 Douglas Fir, 309 Norway Spruce, 389 Scots Pine, 297 Maritime Pine and 762 Silver Fir. These trees were felled and measured in 26 different forests (62 stands). Tree form factor was analysed, rather than volume, to remove heteroscedasticity, and height was substituted by a hardiness coefficient to remove diameter\textendash height correlation. The analysis identified species-specific modes of variation of tree form with respect to developmental stage and tree hardiness. Maritime and Scots Pine did not differ statistically, despite large differences between ecological and silvicultural situations of both species. This suggests the possibility to use identical volume equations for species belonging to the same genus. Regional variations of tree form were explored by a cross-validation technique. Prediction biases did not exhibit a clear geographic structure. A 5\% overestimation for hardwoods in southern sites is possible, and would deserve further testing. The hypothesis that recent growth changes may have slightly altered tree form is also discussed. Finally, a national-scale application provided Biomass Expansion Factors consistent with former studies and suggested that these volume equations behave well in extrapolation to coppices, uneven-aged or mixed stands.},

Further, we performed hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), redundancy analysis (RDA) and bootstrapped correlation analysis to reveal differences in chronologies and climategrowth relationships between aspect and social class. Climatic variables considered in our analyses were monthly and seasonal data on temperature and precipitation, as well as a self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (scPDSI). We identified drought in the period June\textendash August as the most prominent factor limiting growth across the valley. Dominant and co-dominant trees at the NW and SW aspects were found to be particularly drought sensitive, whereas intermediate trees were less susceptible to drought. Underlying causes of established climate\textendash growth relationships are discussed in the context of drought susceptibility, tree-size modulation and tree physiological processes.},

  abstract = {Intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) are anatomical features formed in response to changes in the environmental conditions within the growing season. These anatomical features are commonly observed in Mediterranean pines, being more frequent in younger and wider tree rings. However, the process behind IADF formation is still unknown. Weekly monitoring of cambial activity and wood formation would fill this void. Although studies describing cambial activity and wood formation have become frequent, this knowledge is still fragmentary in the Mediterranean region. Here we present data from the monitoring of cambial activity and wood formation in two diameter classes of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.), over two years, in order to test: (i) whether the differences in stem diameter in an even-aged stand were due to timings and/or rates of xylogenesis; (ii) if IADFs were more common in large trees; and (iii) if their formation is triggered by cambial resumption after the summer drought. Larger trees showed higher rates of cell production and longer growing seasons, due to an earlier start and later end of xylogenesis. When a drier winter occurs, larger trees were more affected, probably limiting xylogenesis in the summer months. In both diameter classes a latewood IADF was formed in 2012 in response to late-September precipitation, confirming that the timing of the precipitation event after the summer drought is crucial in determining the resumption of cambial activity and whether or not an IADF is formed. It was the first time that the formation of a latewood IADF was monitored at a weekly time scale in maritime pine. The capacity of maritime pine to adjust cambial activity to the current environmental conditions represents a valuable strategy under the future climate change conditions.},

  abstract = {Tree growth is one of the most studied aspects of tree biology, particularly secondary growth. In the Mediterranean region, cambial activity is mostly determined by water availability. Climatic projections for the Mediterranean region predict more frequent and intense droughts, and longer periods without precipitation. To investigate tree growth under the predicted scenarios of climate change, a water manipulation experiment was conducted in a maritime pine stand (Pinus pinaster Aiton). In 2017, fifteen trees were divided into three groups: control, rain exclusion, and irrigation. Drought conditions were simulated by installing a continuous plastic sheet on the forest floor from March to September. Trees under irrigation treatment were watered twice a week in September. Cambial activity and xylem formation was monitored every 10 days from February 2017 until March 2018. Cell production was maximal around the spring equinox in all treatments. Trees under rain exclusion decreased cell production rates, xylogenesis duration, and latewood cell wall thickness. The extra irrigation in September did not produce noticeable differences in xylogenesis compared to trees in the control treatment. The synchronization of maximum cambial division rates around the vernal equinox (spring) could allow Mediterranean trees to mitigate the impact of summer drought. With the predicted increase in drought intensity and frequency, lower tree productivity, carbon sequestration, and wood biomass are expected.},

  abstract = {Trees change throughout their life stages, and although age-dependent changes are reported in the literature, the early life stages of trees are often excluded from these studies. The sapling/pole life stage corresponds to the establishment phase of a tree in the forest. To understand how wood formation changes in the early growing stages we compared xylogenesis in saplings/pole (10\textendash 15 years old) and young trees (50\textendash 55 years old). Trees were selected from two adjacent areas in different regeneration phases from a maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton) plantation located on the west coast of Portugal. The cambial and differentiating xylem cells were monitored from March 2015 to March 2017. The climatic conditions in these years were contrasting: 2015 was hot and dry and 2016 wet. Xylogenesis started around the same time in both age-classes but ended later in young trees in both years. Despite the shorter duration, sapling/pole trees formed more tracheids than young trees in both years, presenting an intensive growth strategy. Tracheids in young trees did not present differences between years, but sapling/pole trees presented fewer tracheids with a higher latewood proportion and smaller lumen area in the driest year (2015). Our results show that sapling/pole trees have an intensive growth strategy, whereas older trees (50\textendash 55 years) present a conservative growth strategy with a longer growing season. If the frequency and intensity of droughts increases, sapling/pole trees will reduce growth immediately, whereas older trees will reduce productivity in the following years. Thus, it is expected that forest productivity will decrease under a scenario of increasing drought.},

Despite safety and efficiency partly compensating for each other physiologically (namely, there is a compensation effect, CE, among traits from the "whole" organism perspective), they are always mathematically described as a trade-off against one another. However, the compensation effect has never been defined and quantified, let alone its role in the xylem water transport and subsequently photosynthesis. Here, we developed an alternative theory to define the CE as a positive relationship between safety and efficiency, and further define a new trade-off index, SETO, that is expressed as CE multiplied by a trade-off factor (differing from the classical average trade-off value). Then, we tested SETO-and CE-photosynthetic rate relationships across different levels based on a common garden experiment using nine conifers and published data for gymnosperms. The results demonstrated that the compensation effect in xylem functions was the dominant force in facilitating photosynthetic rates from species-to phylum-scale. By integrating the compensation effect into the xylem hydraulic functional strategy, our study clearly indicated that the compensation effect is the evolutionary basis for the coordination of xylem hydraulic and photosynthesis physiology.},

  abstract = {Tropical forest canopies house most of the globe's diversity, yet little is known about global patterns and drivers of canopy diversity. Here, we present models of ant species density, using climate, abundance and habitat (i.e. canopy versus litter) as predictors. Ant species density is positively associated with temperature and precipitation, and negatively (or non-significantly) associated with two metrics of seasonality, precipitation seasonality and temperature range. Ant species density was significantly higher in canopy samples, but this difference disappeared once abundance was considered. Thus, apparent differences in species density between canopy and litter samples are probably owing to differences in abundance\textendash diversity relationships, and not differences in climate\textendash diversity relationships. Thus, it appears that canopy and litter ant assemblages share a common abundance\textendash diversity relationship influenced by similar but not identical climatic drivers.},

In many regions, people use weaver ants for food, medicine, and/or as biological control agents. There are two recognized species of weaver ants: Oecophylla longinoda (Latreille, 1802) in Africa and Oecophylla smaragdina (Fabricius, 1775) in Asia, Australia, and the Western Pacific. Here, I mapped the geographic distribution of O. smaragdina based on {$>$}2700 site records from 21 countries: Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor Leste, and Vietnam. The vast majority of O. smaragdina records come from areas with Tropical (Group A) climates according to the K\"oppen-Geiger system: rainforest (Af), monsoon (Am), and savanna (Aw). However, {$>$}250 records come from areas classified on the map as having a Subtropical (Group C) climates, mostly in the Himalayan foothills of India and Nepal, southern China, northern Vietnam, and the southern coast of Queensland, Australia. Almost all these sites are classified as dry winter subtropical climate (Cwa). A few O. smaragdina sites are classified as having Arid (Group B) climates, all from warm semi-arid (BSh) areas. This range map based on site records corrects inaccuracies in earlier published range maps.},

On Christmas Island, the invasive yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes; YCA), found in association with introduced honeydew-producing scale insects, can reach extraordinary densities, triggering an ecological meltdown. In this study, we utilized stable isotope analysis to determine resource use of YCAs in naturally occurring low- and high-density populations, and we conducted laboratory experiments mimicking availability of honeydew to measure effects of carbohydrate subsidies on colony growth and worker behavior. High-density YCA populations in nature incorporated a larger proportion of plant-based resources in their diet than low-density populations, and laboratory colonies with access to greater sugar resources had larger colony sizes, higher reproduction rates and worker survival, and higher per capita activity levels and showed higher aggression and potency toward opponents. These results support the positive feedback mechanism between honeydew-producing insects and YCAs that underlies the ecological meltdown on Christmas Island, and add to the growing body of literature illustrating the importance of mutualistic interactions in the success of invasive species.},

  abstract = {喀斯特(岩溶)地貌在我国西南广泛分布,云南西双版纳地区的喀斯特地貌面积高达19\%。喀斯特地貌由于土层浅薄,土壤保水能力差,许多植物生长在裸露的岩石上,即使在多雨的湿润地区,植物频繁遭受到干旱胁迫。而气候变化导致的温度升高和降水格局改变可能会影响到树木的生长速率和季节物候。研究喀斯特生境树木年内径向生长动态及其对环境因子的响应,可为了解喀斯特生境植物的生长策略及其对季节性干旱的适应提供参考。本研究选取云南西双版纳热带喀斯特生境中的2个落叶树种苦楝(Melia azedarach)和多花白头树(Garuga floribunda)及1个常绿树种菲律宾朴树(Celtis philippensis)为研究对象,利用高精度树木径向生长测量仪、微树芯和热耗散液流探针连续两年监测树木的径向生长和树干液流的动态变化,与同步监测的环境因子进行相关分析,并结合植物生理生态过程分析树木生长,得出以下主要结论:(1)在日尺度上,3个研究树种的树干径向变化都存在明显的昼夜循环模式。在年际尺度上,3个研究树种在2018年和2019年都表现出了季节性变化的特征。2019年3个研究树种开始生长的时间晚于2018年,可能与2019年生长季早期遭到的高温干旱有关。落叶树种2019年的年生长量要略低于2018年,而常绿树种2019年的年生长量高于2018年。(2)苦楝的径向日净增长量与降水和相对湿度呈正相关关系,说明苦楝的生长主要受到了水分的限制;而多花白头树的径向日净增长量与环境因子的响应并不敏感。常绿树种菲律宾朴树的径向日净增长量与日最高气温、光合有效辐射、水汽压亏缺和风速呈正相关关系,说明菲律宾朴树的生长主要受温度的影响。(3)在季节性干旱的地区,形成层活动存在``非活动''的休眠期和活动期。多花白头树形成层细胞开始活动的时间早于苦楝,但两个树种的最大形成层细胞层数相似。对于同一树种而言,由于年际间气候的差异,形成层细胞在分裂的时间和数量上也有所不同。(4)苦楝和多花白头树木质部分化的季节动态相似,但在分化时间上存在差异。多花白头树的年生长量大于苦楝,但最大生长速率小于苦楝,最大生长速率出现的时间晚于苦楝。同一树种不同年份上,木质部分化的时间存在差异,2018年苦楝开始生长的时间早于2019年,结束时间晚于2019年,生长季较长,年生长量大于2019年,但最大生长速率要小于2019年。(5)3个研究树种的树干液流密度与光合有效辐射(PAR)、日最高气温(Tmax)和水汽压亏缺(VPD)均为正相关关系,而与相对湿度(RH)为负相关关系。就两个落叶树种而言,苦楝比多花白头树更耐旱。在日尺度上,树干液流密度与最大日收缩呈显著正相关关系,但液流密度与树干径向变化的日动态并不同步,存在一定的时滞。(6)热带喀斯特森林树木形成层活动和径向生长受光合作用和水分关系的调控。落叶树种在生长速率最高的时候,净光合速率也达到峰值。常绿树种菲律宾朴树净光合速率整年无明显波动,与径向生长并没有发现明显的关联。研究树种的树木水分亏缺与叶片的凌晨和正午水势之间存在负相关关系。正午水势越大,遭到的水分胁迫越严重。},

In this study, stem radial variations in larch (Larix principis-rupprechtii) and spruce (Picea meyeri) were monitored using high-resolution point dendrometers over six years (2014\textendash 2019) in a mixed coniferous stand in semi-humid China. The extracted hourly tree water deficit-induced stem shrinkage (TWD) and stem radial increment (SRI) were compared between tree species and among years, and the speciesspecific responses of the daily maximum TWD and cumulative SRI to environmental variables were fitted by linear mixed models. Averagely, larch had a lower TWD and greater SRI rate than spruce in all six growing seasons. The interspecific differences in the TWD (length, magnitude, and intensity) were significant in dry years, while significant differences in the SRI rates were in wet years. The SRI rate of larch showed a more rapid decrease than that of spruce with increasing intensity of TWD. Furthermore, the TWD of both species was mainly regulated by vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and soil water content (SWC). The TWD of larch had a stronger and earlier response to VPD, while TWD of spruce was more affected by SWC (10 cm depth). The daily SRI of larch was more significantly related to all the measured environmental variables, indicating a more sensitive response to environmental drivers than that of spruce. We identified a shift in competitive advantage from sensitive L. principis-rupprechtii to conservative P. meyeri under extreme drought conditions, providing deep insights into species-specific water and carbon dynamics in mixed forests.},

The aggressiveness of the attracted ants and their temporal activity patterns are important factors that can affect the efficiency of herbivore exclusion from the plant. However, the characteristics of this mutualistic relationship between EFN-bearing plants and ants have not been sufficiently elucidated. We investigated the aggressiveness of six ant species against the common armyworm, Spodoptera litura Fabr., and temporal fluctuations in the abundance of four aggressive ant species on an EFN-bearing plant, Mallotus japonicus (L.f.) M\"ull. Arg. Workers of Crematogaster teranishii Santschi, Pheidole noda Smith, Pristomyrmex punctatus Smith and Formica japonica Motschoulsky were observed to be highly aggressive. In contrast, workers of Camponotus vitiosus Smith showed low aggressiveness. Paratrechina flavipes Smith workers did not attack the herbivore. The activity patterns of the four aggressive ant species greatly differed. Crematogaster teranishii and Ph. noda workers were constantly active throughout the day and night. In contrast, F. japonica was diurnal. Pristomyrmex punctatus was principally nocturnal. Formica japonica workers foraged solitarily, whereas workers of the other three species foraged in a group or recruited nestmates. Our results suggest that the efficacy of the indirect defense in M. japonicus depends principally on the attracted ant species.},

This study investigated the intra-annual dynamics of xylem and phloem formation of Picea crassifolia and their relationship at two latitudes of arid and semi-arid forests in China. The results showed that both xylem and phloem formation varied at different latitudes. Xylem formation at the low-latitude site (Luoshan) started two weeks earlier than that at the high-latitude site (Helanshan) but ended one week later, resulting in an extended growing season at the low-latitude site. Phloem formation preceded cambium activity and xylogenesis at both sites by 24.6 days in Luoshan, which had warmer conditions, and by 17.3 days in Helanshan. In Luoshan, compared to Helanshan, there occurred significantly more enlarging and wall thickening cells, during (relatively wet) June\textendash August, but significantly fewer enlarging and wall thickening cells as well as total xylem cells, during (relatively dry) April\textendash May. Sample trees produced significantly fewer early phloem cells during the early growing season (April\textendash May) in Luoshan, but generated significantly more late phloem cells during the late growing season in Helanshan. Additionally, different trade-offs between xylem and phloem formation were observed at different sites. The longer duration of early phloem formation might have shortened the duration of xylem lignification in Helanshan; in Luoshan, the date that late phloem reached its maximum growth rate was significantly positively correlated with the date when xylem lignification ended. The results revealed the plasticity of xylem and phloem formation under changing environmental conditions and a complex and site-specific relationship between xylem and phloem formation. These findings could help us better understand and predict the future growth of arid and semi-arid forests in China in response to climate change.},

Native and thermally modified twin samples of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), and European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) were analyzed. The samples differed in terms of shape, geometry, and climatic state. On the one hand, the samples were oven dry as usual and, on the other hand, conditioned at 22 \textdegree C and 95 \% relative humidity. Furthermore, the samples were processed using solvent exchange drying. In addition to helium, nitrogen was used as a displacement gas. The tests show i.a. how this can lead to misinterpretation of the cell-wall density or porosity of wood determined by gas pycnometry. The results show that native spruce has a lower cell-wall density and higher porosity compared with native maple and ash. Due to thermal modification, the cell-wall densities are decreased. The investigations show that the determined cell-wall density and porosity of the wood are strongly dependent on the sample geometry and climatic state. The cell-wall densities of all investigated wood species in the conditioned state at 22 \textdegree C and 95 \% relative humidity are significantly higher compared with the oven-dry cell-wall densities.},

Long-term observations from experimental forest management trials were used, together with retrospective climate information from 1904 up to 2012. A special focus is given to the role of transformation of modelling basal area increment, helping to normalize the random error distribution. A nonlinear model formulation was used to describe the basic relation between basal area increment and diameter at breast height. This formulation was widely expanded by groups of explanatory variables, describing competition, stand development, site, stand density, thinning, mixture, and climate. The models are species-specific and contain different explanatory variables per group, being able to explain a high amount of variance (on the original scale, up to 80\% in the case of Quercus spec.). Different transformations of the nonlinear relation where tested and based on the mean squared error, the square root transformation performed best. Although the residuals were homoscedastic, they were still long-tailed and not normal distributed, making robust statistics the preferred method for statistical inference. Climate is included as a nonlinear and interacting effect of temperature, precipitation and moisture, with a biological meaningful interpretation per tree species, e.g., showing better growth for Abies alba in warm and wet climates and good growing conditions for Picea abies in colder and dryer climates, being less sensitive on temperature. Furthermore, a linear increase in growth was found to be present since the 1940s. Potentially this is an effect of the increased atmospheric CO2 concentration or changed management in terms of reduced nutrient subtractions from forest ground, since industrialization lowered the demand of residue and slash uptake.},

If the timings and duration of xylem formation change, xylogenesis can occur under different environmental conditions and subsequently be subject to different climatic signals. An experimental design was applied in the field to disentangle the effects of age and size on xylem phenology, and it challenges the hypothesis that the timings and dynamics of xylem growth are size-dependent. Intra-annual dynamics of xylem formation were monitored weekly during the growing seasons 2013 and 2014 in Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) and Qilian juniper (Juniperus przewalskii) with different sizes and ages in a semi-arid region of northwestern China. Cell differentiation started 3 weeks earlier in 2013 and terminated 1 week later in 2014 in small-young pines than in big-old pines. However, differences in the timings of growth reactivation disappeared when comparing the junipers with different sizes but similar age. Overall, 77 days were required for xylem differentiation to take place, but timings were shorter for older trees, which also exhibited smaller cell production. Results from this study suggest that tree age does play an important role in timings and duration of growth. The effect of age should also be considered to perform reliable responses of trees to climate.},

Such an understanding could also shed light on the physiological foundation of climate\textendash growth interactions at a regional scale. Although it has been documented that temperature is an important factor determining the cambial phenology in cold and humid climates, there is less agreement on the driver(s) that trigger the onset and end of wood formation in cold and arid climates. Here, the phenological traits of cambial activity and xylem formation were analyzed biweekly along an altitudinal transect ranging from 3580 to 3980 m above sea level, a transect that covers the distribution of Qilian juniper (Juniperus przewalskii Kom.) along a slope of the Tibetan Plateau. Cambial phenology and the duration and rate of wood formation were assessed from anatomical observations during the growing season of the developing xylem obtained from microcores collected from the stem of 10 trees total in 2012 (five at two altitudes each) and 25 trees (five at five altitudes each) in 2013. We found that the onset of wood formation was significantly correlated with altitude in 2013, with onset beginning 8.2 days earlier with every 100 m decrease in elevation. The change in onset with elevation corresponds to a change of 14.1 days \textdegree C\textendash 1 when adjusted for the monitored altitudinal lapse rate of -0.58 \textdegree C per 100 m. The duration of wood formation lasted from mid-May to mid-August, with the length of the 2013 growing season decreasing from 97 to 65 days from low to high elevation. Although the end of growing season appeared minimally related to altitude during both growing seasons, differences in end of wood production and wood formation between the two growing seasons were significant. It appears that summer drought conditions constricted the end of growing season across all elevations along our transect in 2013. Sensitivity analysis found xylem growth was positively correlated with rate and duration of wood production, with the former explaining most variability in growth. Our findings provide new data on the timing and duration of wood formation and help quantify the potential impacts of global warming on tree growth and productivity in cold and arid regions.},

Here, we analyzed phenological traits related to observed cambial phenology and xylogenesis over the course of two extreme hydroclimatic years across six sites that span the spatial distribution of Qilian juniper (Juniperus przewalskii Kom.) in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Cambial phenology and xylogenesis were assessed weekly or biweekly from the microcores of 30 trees. We found that the onset of xylogenesis significantly correlated with annual mean and minimum temperatures, regardless of the moisture conditions, resulting in an advance of the onset of xylogenesis of 10.1 days \textdegree C-1. In contrast, the end of xylogenesis was related to both maximum temperatures and drought conditions. The contrast in drought conditions over the two growing seasons made the importance of the water balance on the end of xylogenesis quite clear. During the extremely dry conditions of 2013, xylogenesis ended up to 30 days earlier than during 2012, a wetter and cooler year. Our results indicate that strong shifts in water availability during the growing season are crucial to the rate of wood production. Also, the significant correlation between the total number of xylem cells and both the duration and rate of wood production, highlights how changes in the timing of xylogenetic processes and the growth rate can have a strong influence on the future growth and performance of J. przewalskii. Our findings indicate that while warming promotes an early growing season and, potentially, a longer growing season, warming and decreased moisture availability has a strong influence on tree growth and productivity in cold and arid regions.},

To explore the correlation and coordination between primary and secondary growth, we monitored the leaf phenology, shoot elongation, and stem growth of co-occurring Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr. and Picea meyeri Rehd. et Wils. in an alpine habitat, Luya Mountain (North-Central China), during the growing season of 2014. We measured bud development on terminal branches three days per week by direct observations and intra-annual stem xylem formation at weekly intervals by the microcores method. The onset sequence of three organs was the needle, shoot, and stem, without species-specific differences. Needles appeared one month earlier than stem growth in larch, while it was only one week earlier in spruce. The duration of needle growth was the shortest, followed by the shoot and stem. The timing of primary growth (i.e., onset, end, and maximum growth rate) between the two species was asynchronous, but secondary growth was synchronic with the same date of the maximum growth rate occurrence, potentially indicating species competition for resources. Unlike larch, spruce staggered growth peaks among different organs, which may effectively mitigate trees' internal competition for resources. Soil temperature was positively correlated with both shoot and stem growth in the two species, whereas air temperature and soil water content were positively correlated with needle growth only in larch. Therefore, it can be inferred that the spruce will probably outcompete the larch at cold alpine treeline sites due to its high adaptability to acquiring and allocating resources. These results provide insight into the potential physiological correlation between primary and secondary growth and allow better prediction of future climate change effects on forest ecosystem productivity.},

  title = {氮添加和增温对北半球中高纬度地区四种典型树种生长的影响},
  author = {张, 邵康},

  abstract = {森林生态系统对维持全球生态系统的平衡发展起着重要作用。人类活动，如大量化石燃料燃烧、土地利用改变等导致的大气氮沉降增加和全球气候变暖对森林生态系统的影响已经成为近年来不可忽视的全球生态问题。北半球中高纬度地区森林生态系统在全球生态系统中具有非常重要的作用，其树木生长显著受到氮素限制和温度的影响，而该地区的氮沉降增加及夜晚增温幅度比白天更大的不平衡增温现象十分明显。因此，在全球气候变化的背景下，研究北半球中高纬度地区氮沉降增加和不平衡增温对树木生长的影响，进而深入理解森林生长、组成、结构及功能，预测森林生态系统的固碳潜力变化趋势已成为当今生态学研究的热点问题。树木生长主要包括初级生长和次级生长，它们的生长变化可直接反映森林生态系统碳汇的变化。树木发芽的物候是表征树木初级生长的重要指标，它的改变可直接影响生长季长短，进而对森林生产力和群落结构等产生影响。木质部形成是次级生长的重要表现指标，且它是树木固碳的重要组织，其动态变化将直接反映森林生产力，进而反映森林固碳潜力和碳汇功能的变化。树木的发芽和木质部的形成对环境因子的响应非常敏感，因此是研究气候和环境因子变化对树木生长的理想指标。针对以上生态学热点问题，我们分别进行了两方面的研究：通过对树木施加氮肥和人工增温来分别研究大气氮沉降增加和气候变暖对树木生长的影响。氮沉降增加模拟研究包括林冠和林下两种施氮方式，在中国中部地区的暖温带森林中进行，并选取在该地区广泛分布的马尾松（Pinus massoniana Lamb）和枫香（Liquidambar formosana Hance）作为研究树种，通过连续监测生长季内的木质部形成来研究树木次级生长在氮沉降增加下的变化。气候变暖模拟研究包括白天增温和夜晚增温两个实验条件，以北美地区广泛分布的优势树种黑云杉[Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP.]和香脂冷杉[Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.]为研究对象，通过每天连续监测来自加拿大41个采集地幼苗的发芽物候变化来研究树木初级生长对不平衡增温的响应。主要研究结果如下：1) 2014-2015年间，中国中部地区暖温带森林中马尾松木质部的形成从3月中旬持续至11月中旬，共形成了19-33个木质部细胞；林下氮添加（25kg N yr-1 hr-1, 1.25倍自然氮沉降量）和对照样地的马尾松平均分别产生了25{$\pm$}2.7个和25{$\pm$}2.1个木质部细胞。通过对比拟合生长曲线的相参数发现，氮添加组和对照组的树木木质部表现出了相似的形成动态。重复测量的方差分析显示，林下加氮处理下木质部形成总量与对照组的并无显著差异。2) 2014-2015年间，中国中部地区暖温带森林中枫香的木质部形成从3月底开始至11月底结束，木质部形成大约持续119-292天，共形成1709-4762{$\mu$}m的木质部宽度。林冠加氮、林下加氮和对照处理下的木质部总形成量分别为：3247{$\mu$}m、1851{$\mu$}m和3701{$\mu$}m；木质部形成的平均速率分别为：23.75、13.84及21.61{$\mu$}m day-1。通过对比拟合生长曲线的相关参数发现，枫香在林冠氮添加（50kg N yr-1 hr-1, 2.5倍自然氮沉降量）和林下氮添加（50kg N yr-1 hr-1）处理下表现出相似的木质部形成（形成速率及形成期）。与对照组相比，氮添加组（林冠加氮和林下加氮）枫香的木质部形成没有显著变化。重复测量的方差分析显示，两种氮添加处理和对照下的木质部总量无显著差异。3) 模拟不平衡增温的研究结果显示，4\textdegree C的增温可使黑云杉和香脂冷杉的发芽平均提前2.4天，且发芽的后期阶段对增温处理的反应更敏感。黑云杉和香脂冷杉在白天增温下的发芽比在夜晚增温下分别平均提前1.2天和3.2天；黑云杉发芽的完成比香脂冷杉的早6.5天。此外，黑云杉表现出了明显的生态型分化，主要体现为来自最温暖地区的幼苗发芽比来自最寒冷地区的晚8.3天。敏感性分析结果表明，相对于夜晚增温，白天增温对两种树种的发芽的影响作用更强。上述结果表明，1）短期的低氮沉降（1.25-2.5倍自然氮沉降量）对中国中部地区暖温带森林中马尾松和枫香的木质部形成无显著影响。由此，我们推测，前人所观察到的树木生长对氮沉降的显著响应结果可能高估了自然条件下短期的大气氮沉降对树木生长的影响。树木生长对氮沉降的显著响应可能发生在大量的氮沉降量或长时期的持续氮沉降情境下。2）增温模拟研究结果表明，在全球气候变暖的背景下，白天增温对树木生长的影响比夜晚增温更强烈。这说明当前基于每天平均温度作为输入参数的全球植被预测模型可能过高地估测了气候变暖对树木生长的影响。模型中应该考虑更高精度的时间尺度上的监测数据，从而更准确的预测全球气候变化下的植物物候、植被动态及森林生产力的变化。综上所述，在全球气候变化背景下，全球氮沉降增加和增温对树木生长的影响可能并不如前人所预测的巨大，但这仍需更长期、多方面的研究方可更准确地评估和预测树木生长、植被变化、森林生产力及碳循环对全球气候变化的响应。},

It is not yet clear how trees will respond to increasing temperature and precipitation variability and other extreme meteorological events that are expected to occur as climate continues to change. Here, we analyzed cambial phenology and xylogenesis of Juniperus przewalskii Kom. weekly (2011\textendash 2014) or biweekly (2015\textendash 2016) over six years on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. We found that temperature plays a decisive role in the onset of xylogenesis and a daily mean temperature of 6.1 \textdegree C appears to be the threshold that determines growth onset. Additionally, we observed the end of xylogenesis is related to summer drought conditions. During the course of our observations, the onset of xylogenesis advanced nearly twice as much as the end of xylogenesis (3.1 vs 1.8 days decade-1, respectively), indicating a slight lengthening of the growing season. However, an increase in the duration of the growing season did not necessarily result in a greater level of wood production. In fact, we found that water availability affects the growth rate and early summer precipitation appears to be a key factor of wood production over the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Our study provides new evidence of the malleable nature of tree growth and reveals potential mechanisms of how tree growth adjusts to climatic variations in cold and arid region.},

  abstract = {山地退化森林生态系统的恢复与重建近年来成为国内外学术界研究领域的热点和难点之一。亚高山温凉性和寒温性森林类型是滇西北三江并流世界自然遗产中典型的地带性植被,具有生态脆弱性和敏感性。本研究以位于滇西北腹心地带的香格里拉县,依据干扰后森林生态系统退化程度的差异而形成的不同群落外貌特征,选取荒草地(极度退化)、灌草丛(重度退化)、疏林灌丛(中度退化)和大果红杉次生林(轻度退化)等4种程度的退化森林生态系统,以未退化川滇高山栎原生林为参照,采用典型样地法设置标准地,调查群落特征,测定各主要环境因子；采用土壤典型取样法,分析土壤理化性质；采用种子萌发鉴定法研究种子库；用种子雨收集框法研究种子雨特征；根据对不同退化特征的研究结果,提出滇西北亚高山退化森林生态系统的恢复对策。研究结果表明：1.在5类不同程度的退化森林群落中,随着退化程度的减轻,群落高度逐渐增加,物种丰富度呈现先增加后下降的趋势；物种组成呈现从草本-灌木-乔木的发展方向,先锋物种逐渐减少并消失,物种特性从阳性-中性-阴性转变；退化程度较高的林地,植物生活型组成以地面芽植物占绝对优势,退化程度较小的林地中,地面芽植物明显减少,中高位芽和小高位芽植物显著增加；从极度退化到未退化,草本层各多样性指数均逐渐下降,灌木层植物的多样性先增大后降低,而乔木层多样性则逐渐增大。2.随着林地退化程度的减轻,林内太阳辐射强度降低,空气及土壤湿度增大,气温、地表温度和土壤温度降低；各环境因子的变幅越小、环境状况越稳定,越有利于植物的发育生长。3.随着退化程度的降低,土壤容重降低,孔隙度不断增加,土壤物理性质向良性发展；同时土壤的化学营养成分均呈现上升趋势,充分表明退化林地的恢复过程也是植被对土壤环境协同改造的过程。4.滇西北亚高山不同程度退化林地土壤种子库物种数量大小顺序为轻度退化{$>$}未退化{$>$}极度退化{$>$}中度退化{$>$}重度退化。种子库密度顺序为极度退化{$>$}中度退化{$>$}轻度退化{$>$}未退化{$>$}重度退化。各退化林地产生种子雨种类和数量均表现出随退化程度的降低而增加的趋势。土壤种子库和种子雨与地上植被的Jaccard相似性系数均较低。土壤种子库对地上植被更新贡献率较小,但对干扰后退化植被的恢复具有重要的潜在作用。种子雨对处于中间退化程度的中度退化和轻度退化的地上植被更新具有重要的作用。5.在所测定的退化特征指标中,乔木层多样性指数、速效磷含量、灌木层多样性指数、高位芽植物比例、乔木层高度、全氮和有机质等7个指标值在5类退化程度群落间的平均变化率超过40\%,对退化程度的指示性最好,可作为主要指标来指示滇西北亚高山森林生态系统的退化状况,并在恢复工作中重点考虑。6.滇西北亚高山退化森林生态系统的恢复对策应以``近自然林业''理论为指导,采用乡土树种,以人工混交林营建和人工促进天然更新为技术手段,恢复生物多样性,兼顾林地生产力和社会经济的谐调发展。},

  abstract = {Climate change has a high chance of stimulating soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition, thereby accelerating carbon release in soil. Alpine ecosystems sequester large amounts of SOC. However, little is known about long-term trends and future changes of SOC in alpine ecosystems. In this study, the Lund-Potsdam-Jena dynamic global vegetation model for China (LPJ-CN) was applied to simulate temporal and spatial responses of soil organic carbon density (SOCD) to climate change in Three-River Headwater (TRH) of the Tibetan Plateau from 1981 to 2100. LPJ-CN is a modified dynamical vegetation model based on Chinese terrestrial ecosystem features. Results suggest that average SOCD for the TRH in the period from 1981 to 2010 was 3.97 kg C m-2. During this period, SOCD increased at an average rate of 0.0001 kg C m-2 yr-1; spatially there was a gradient of decreasing SOCD from east to west across the TRH. Under climate change scenarios, SOCD over TRH as a whole is projected to decrease until reaching it lowest level circa 2070, and to rise thereafter. However there may be some regional variation, with SOCD increasing in west TRH and decreasing in east TRH. This decreasing trend may be enhanced further in a warming climate. However, the pattern of higher SOCD in the east and lower SOCD in the west may have less variation in the future. In general, climate warming in the future may lead to a corresponding decrease in SOCD in TRH, which may accelerate carbon release from alpine soils.},

A coupled biogeography and biogeochemistry model called BIOME4 was modified by redefining the bioclimatic limits of key plant function types on the basis of the regional vegetation\textendash climate relationships in China. Compared to existing natural vegetation distribution, BIOME4 is proven more reliable in simulating the overall vegetation distribution in China. Possible changes in vegetation distribution were simulated under climate change scenarios by using the improved model. Simulation results suggest that regional climate change would result in dramatic changes in vegetation distribution. Climate change may increase the areas covered by tropical forests, warm-temperate forests, savannahs/dry woodlands and grasslands/dry shrublands, but decrease the areas occupied by temperate forests, boreal forests, deserts, dry tundra and tundra across China. Most vegetation in east China, specifically the boreal forests and the tropical forests, may shift their boundaries northwards. The tundra and dry tundra on the Tibetan Plateau may be progressively confined to higher elevation.},

  abstract = {在气候变化的背景下，深入理解树木径向生长与气候变化之间的关系是全球气候变化研究的热点。树木径向生长与气候的关系会随着气候的变化而逐渐发生改变，通过以空间代替时间，探究树木径向生长与气候的关系沿海拔和纬度梯度的变化，对评估和预测气候变化下树木生长具有重要的科学意义。目前虽然有研究表明阿尔泰山不同海拔和纬度下的树木径向生长与气候关系存在差异，但是定量和分离不同气候因子对径向生长贡献率的研究则较为缺乏。本研究通过建立海拔和纬度梯度的不同样点，对西伯利亚落叶松(Larix sibirica)树轮宽度标准年表与气候因子分别进行相关、多元线性回归和线性混合模型等统计分析，并进一步计算了线性模型中不同气候因子的绝对和相对贡献率，从而定量和分离关键气候因子对新疆阿尔泰山不同海拔和不同纬度西伯利亚落叶松径向生长的影响。主要研究结果如下：(1)在海拔梯度上，高海拔地区，当年6月温度和上一年7月降水分别与西伯利亚落叶松的径向生长呈现显著的正相关和负相关，两者共同解释其径向生长变异的33.1\%，其相对贡献率分别为66.2\%和33.8\%；中海拔地区，当年6月温度和上一年6月降水分别与西伯利亚落叶松的径向生长呈显著的正相关和负相关，两者共同解释其径向生长变异的26.8\%，其相对贡献率分别为40.1\%和59.9\%；低海拔地区，上一年6月温度和7月的降水分别与西伯利亚落叶松的径向生长呈现显著的负相关和正相关，两者共同解释其径向生长变异的29.4\%，其相对贡献率分别为31.9\%和68.1\%。这表明限制西伯利亚落叶松径向生长的主要影响因子因海拔而异，温度是高海拔地区树木径向生长的主要限制因子，而降雨是低海拔地区树木径向生长的主要限制因子。(2)在纬度梯度上，当年4月的帕尔默干旱指数(PDSI)与西伯利亚落叶松的径向生长呈显著的正相关，而上一年6月的最低温(Tmin)和上一年7月的月温差(Tmax-Tmin)均与径向生长呈显著的负相关。在线性混合模型中，这3个气候因子共同解释了西伯利亚落叶松径向生长变异的41.4\%，其中当年4月的PDSI是影响西伯利亚落叶松径向生长的主要气候因子，其绝对贡献率为23\%。此外，上一年6月的最低温与径向生长的关系沿纬度梯度而显著增强。因此，该研究结果通过沿海拔和纬度梯度，系统的阐述了气候变化对阿尔泰山西伯利亚落叶松径向生长的影响，为全球变化下森林的科学管理提供依据。},

  abstract = {树木生长-气候关系对准确评估气候变化对森林生态系统影响、预测森林生产力与植被动态及揭示树木对气候变化的响适应策略至关重要,该关系会随时间、空间及树种的差异而改变。现有研究主要集中在针叶树或中小尺度下的年轮-气候响应关系,有关大尺度下阔叶树生长-气候响应关系时空变异及驱动机制的研究较少。全球变化背景下,本研究以我国东北温带阔叶红松(Pins koraiensis)林内4种主要阔叶树\textemdash 水曲柳(Fraxinus mandshurica)、黄菠萝(Phellodendronamurense)、蒙古栎(Quercusmongolica)和胡桃楸(Juglans mandshurica)为研究对象,从径向生长与导管形成角度揭示大尺度下阔叶树宏微观生长-气候关系时空变异规律及驱动机制。主要结果如下:蒙古栎的环孔材特性最明显,仅1-2排大导管,水曲柳和黄菠萝次之;环孔材水力直径(Dh)和平均导管面积(MVA)较大但导管数量(N)较少,而半环孔材胡桃楸则恰好相反。环孔材幼树(0-10a)阶段导管多且小,分布更接近半环孔材,表明幼树与成年树抗旱策略不同,是生存与生长权衡的结果。胡桃楸年轮宽度(RWL)显著高于其它3个树种,而蒙古栎最小。水曲柳导管特征密度(VD)显著高于其它3个树种,而蒙古栎导管总面积(TVA)仅为其它树种的1/2。4个树种解剖结构的差异能够反映物种间生态习性差异。各树种RWL和N总体随形成层年龄增加而减小且趋势不明显;导管特征Dh和MVA,在幼龄阶段(25～45a)均随形成层年龄增加而快速上升,达到某一``拐点''后,该趋势明显变缓或消失,这可能与高生长速率的转变有关;VD也表现出随形成层年龄增加而增加的趋势但``拐点''不存在或不明显;而TVA随形成层年龄增加变化不大。年龄趋势中``拐点''的存在为规避去趋势提供了可能。各树种RWL与VD均呈负相关,尤其是水曲柳和蒙古栎;而与其它导管特征总体呈正相关(尤其是N)。导管的数量密度与导管直径总体呈负相关,是水力效率性与安全性权衡的结果。4个树种RWL和TVA均主要由N决定,而不是MVA;N对RWL主要表现为直接影响,通过TVA和VD途径的间接影响较弱。4个树种年轮宽度和导管主要特征(VD除外),总体上存在``南高北低''的格局,这是对采样点气候适应的结果;也是对树种习性、树龄、树高或高生长速率适应的体现。总体而言,4种阔叶树导管特征的空间变化证明了木质部水力结构的可塑性以及随树龄或样点环境变化导管主要功能间的权衡。温度是限制4个树种径向生长的主要气候因子,降水的限制作用较弱;其中均温和低温对4个树种的径向生长整体呈促进作用(尤其是低温),其中水曲柳径向生长与两者的响应最好而胡桃楸相对较弱。4个树种RWL与水分因子(降水、平均相对湿度及SPEI)的相关性总体表现出从北到南由正相关转为负相关的趋势,在季节与指标间差异较大;与温度总体上均呈正相关(尤其是低温)。其中黄菠萝和蒙古栎RWL与温度正相关显著的样点主要集中在南部,北部样点相关不显著;北部样点RWL与夏季温度呈负相关,表明研究区北部干旱胁迫更明显。水曲柳RWL与均温及低温在几乎所有样点正相关显著;其与高温(尤其是秋季)正相关显著的样点主要集中在北部,可能与延长生长季长度有关。胡桃楸RWL与3种温度指标的空间变化规律(北部正相关较强)似乎不同于黄菠萝和蒙古栎,这是不同材性树种水分利用策略差异的体现。过强(水曲柳)或过弱(胡桃楸)的相关均能遮蔽空间变异信号,这是水曲柳和胡桃楸径向生长与温度相关性空间变异不明显的原因。生长-气候关系空间变异的发生因季节、气候因子及树种类型的不同而存在差异。经纬度、海拔或微地形等因素导致的气候限制因子改变是造成阔叶树年轮气候关系空间变异的主要原因,大尺度气候涛动可能是区域上空间变异的外在驱动。快速(1970-80s)升温以后,环孔材树种(水曲柳、黄菠萝和蒙古栎)与温度的相关性均由不显著的负或正相关转变为显著正相关,而半环孔材胡桃楸则由显著正相关转为显著负相关;水曲柳和黄菠萝生长与水分的相关性总体上均由不显著的负或正相关转变为显著正相关。就蒙古栎和胡桃楸而言,在南部地区受水分的限制作用由负转正再转负,而北部则由负相关转为显著正相关。阔叶树生长-气候关系的时间变异,可能与升温导致的干旱胁迫有关;随着变暖速度的减缓,这种随时间的变异减弱。温度是影响温带森林内4种阔叶树导管特征的主要气候因子;各指标与均温及低温正相关且一致性较高,与高温的相关性一致性差。4种阔叶树导管特征与生长季初水分正相关,与其它季节水分主要呈负相关。4个树种导管特征与温度或降水的相关性存在季节差异,可能与树木的材性及物候有关。4种阔叶树主要导管特征与气候因子的相关性总体表现出与宽度一致的空间变异规律,即与水分相关性由北到南正效应减弱,而温度的正效应则增强,表明北部样点受干旱胁迫更严重。蒙古栎和胡桃楸的RWL、N和TVA与气候因子的相关常与VD、Dh和MVA相反;各指标间的关系及气候代表性因树种或季节不同而存在差异。温度对南部树木生长(导管特征)的正效应较强,而对北部树木生长的正效应较弱或表现为负效应,这在一定程度上印证了宏观上的年轮-气候关系。},

Values of {$\increment$}W were determined by monitoring stem radius changes with dendrometers and detrending the results for growth. We followed changes in {$\increment$}W and {$\increment$}WE in Pinus sylvestris L. and Quercus pubescens Willd. over 2 years at a dry site (2001\textendash 2002; Salgesch, Wallis) and in Picea abies (L.)

  abstract = {The timing of diel stem growth of mature forest trees is still largely unknown, as empirical data with high temporal resolution have not been available so far. Consequently, the effects of day-night conditions on tree growth remained uncertain.  Here we present the first comprehensive field study of hourly-resolved radial stem growth of seven temperate tree species, based on 57 million underlying data points over a period of up to 8 years.  We show that trees grow mainly at night, with a peak after midnight, when the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) is among the lowest. A high VPD strictly limits radial stem growth and allows little growth during daylight hours, except in the early morning. Surprisingly, trees also grow in moderately dry soil when the VPD is low. Speciesspecific differences in diel growth dynamics show that species able to grow earlier during the night are associated with the highest number of hours with growth per year and the largest annual growth increment.  We conclude that species with the ability to overcome daily water deficits faster have greater growth potential. Furthermore, we conclude that growth is more sensitive than carbon uptake to dry air, as growth stops before stomata are known to close.},
